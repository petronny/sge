Unlike the packages shipped with Debian, this native version of the
packaging is intended as an add-on, installing into /opt/sge in
vanilla form for sharing in a cluster.  (Obviously it can also be used
for non-shared installations.)

It needs to be further installed as usual by running ./inst_sge in
/opt/sge to create a suitable cell.  The only real configuration it
does on the installation system is to create an "sgeadmin" account for
convenience.

If building with a recent version of debuild(1) which doesn't allow
overriding this in the package, give it the argument
  --suppress-tags dir-or-file-in-opt
to avoid a lot of noise, e.g.
  debuild -uc -us -b --lintian-opts --suppress-tags dir-or-file-in-opt

This packaging supports, but doesn't require, the "hardening-wrapper"
package.  It's probably a good idea to build with hardening-wrapper
installed to provide some robustness to the built daemons
<http://wiki.debian.org/Hardening>.
