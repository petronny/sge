Unlike the packages shipped with Debian, this native version of the
packaging is intended as an add-on, installing into /opt/sge in
vanilla form for sharing in a cluster.  (Obviously it can also be used
for non-shared installations.)

It needs to be further installed as usual by running ./inst_sge in
/opt/sge to create a suitable cell.  The only real configuration it
does on the installation system is to create an "sgeadmin" account for
convenience.
