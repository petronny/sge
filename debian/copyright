 .
 Hi Michael,
 .
 terrific news about integrating Grid Engine into Debian! Are you
 building binaries yourself or are you using the bits we provide?
 .
 Per your licensing question: Yes, you can assume that everything not
 explicitly licensed is copyrighted by Sun and is under the SISSL.
 .
 Thanks for pointing out that some files did not contain proper copyright
 notices. We did a quick check and found only XPM files and JavaDocs
 missing them. Did you come across any other files without copyright notices?
 .
 Cheers,
 .
 Fritz

 Hi Afif, yes I'm the same Charles. I haven't thought of this code in a long
 time and I'm happy that it's still in use. :)
 .
 I'm fine with the code being changed to a DFSG-compatible License, e.g.
 LGPLv3 or any later version.
 .
 Thanks for taking the time to look me up and ask!
 .
 Charles

 3.0 DISTRIBUTION OBLIGATIONS
 .
 3.1 Application of License.
 The Source Code version of Original Code may be distributed only under
 the terms of this License or a future version of this License released
 under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with
 every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or
 impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts
 the applicable version of this License or the recipients rights
 hereunder. Your license for shipment of the Contributor Version is
 conditioned upon Your full compliance with this Section. The
 Modifications which You create must comply with all requirements set
 out by the Standards body in effect one hundred twenty (120) days
 before You ship the Contributor Version. In the event that the
 Modifications do not meet such requirements, You agree to publish
 either (i) any deviation from the Standards protocol resulting from
 implementation of Your Modifications and a reference implementation of
 Your Modifications or (ii) Your Modifications in Source Code form, and
 to make any such deviation and reference implementation or
 Modifications available to all third parties under the same terms a
 this license on a royalty free basis within thirty (30) days of Your
 first customer shipment of Your Modifications. Additionally, in the
 event that the Modifications you create do not meet the requirements
 set out in this Section, You agree to comply with the Standards
 requirements set out in Exhibit B.
 3.2 Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in
 each file of the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice
 in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must
 include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where
 a user would be likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or
 more Modification(s) You may add Your name as a Contributor to the
 notice described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in
 any documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients
 rights or ownership rights relating to Initial Code.
 You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
 indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Your
 version of the Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf,
 and not on behalf of the Initial Developer. You must make it absolutely
 clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability
 obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify
 the Initial Developer for any liability incurred by the Initial
 Developer as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability
 terms You offer.
 3.3 Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Original
 Code in Executable and Source form only if the requirements of Sections
 3.1 and 3.2 have been met for that Original Code, and if You include a
 notice stating that the Source Code version of the Original Code is
 available under the terms of this License. The notice must be
 conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable or Source
 versions, related documentation or collateral in which You describe
 recipients rights relating to the Original Code. You may distribute the
 Executable and Source versions of Your version of the Code or ownership
 rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms
 different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with
 the terms of this License. If You distribute the Executable and Source
 versions under a different license You must make it absolutely clear
 that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone,
 not by the Initial Developer. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
 Developer for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer as a
 result of any such terms You offer.
 3.4 Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Original
 Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and
 distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You
 must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the
 Original Code.
 4.0 INABILITY TO COMPLY DUE TO STATUTE OR REGULATION
 If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
 License with respect to some or all of the Original Code due to
 statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
 the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
 describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description
 must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.2 and must be
 included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the
 extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
 sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
 understand it.
 5.0 APPLICATION OF THIS LICENSE
 This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has
 attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Modifications as set
 out in Section 3.1.
 6.0 VERSIONS OF THE LICENSE

 License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing
 version number.

 a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it
 under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such
 Original Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License
 published by Sun. No one other than Sun has the right to modify the
 terms applicable to Original Code.
 7.0 DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY
 ORIGINAL CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN AS IS BASIS, WITHOUT
 WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
 LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE ORIGINAL CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS,
 MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE
 ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE ORIGINAL CODE IS
 WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY ORIGINAL CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU
 (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING,
 REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN
 ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY ORIGINAL CODE IS
 AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.
 8.0 TERMINATION
 8.1 This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
 automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure
 such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All
 sublicenses to the Original Code which are properly granted shall
 survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their
 nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License
 shall survive. 8.2 In the event of termination under Section 8.1 above,
 all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)
 which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder
 prior to termination shall survive termination.
