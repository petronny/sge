It is unclear what the effect is of its the `Standards' language.  At
the time of writing (January 2011) the reference to the "Reference
Build binaries" from the relevant page on the gridengine.sunsource.net
site (dumped as file "standards" in this directory) is a broken link
to what appears to have been a (long-obsolete) version 5.3, and an
announcement has been made of the imminent closure of
gridengine.sunsource.net.  This version hasn't yet been checked
against a Sun-released version with the procedure described in
doc/compatibility_test.html, but presumably a positive compatibility
test result against any such version is sufficient to justify the
naming, which is a requirement of the SISSL EXHIBIT B.  This version
is likely not compatible on the wire with any Sun-released version --
many (most?) of which were incompatible with each other -- so it will
probably be necessary to maintain a compatibility mode against 6.2u5.
However, the code which changes the qmaster communication is from the
original gridengine repository.

Update:  Legal advice is that the requirements of Exhibit B only apply
if you don't fulfil the requirements set out in section 3.1 of the
SISSL.
