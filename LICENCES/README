Most of this distribution is licensed under the terms of the Sun
Industry Standards Source License; see the file SISSL.  However, code
under other licences is linked with it and some standalone programs
have other licences.  If copyright notices are missing from files from
the original Sun distribution, Fritz Ferstl said at
http://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail/pkg-gridengine-devel/2007-June/000021.html
"Yes, you can assume that everything not explicitly licensed is
copyrighted by Sun and is under the SISSL."  See also

It is somewhat unclear what the effect is of its the `Standards'
language.  At the time of writing (January 2011) the reference to the
"Reference Build binaries" from the relevant page on the
gridengine.sunsource.net site (dumped as file "standards" in this
directory) is a broken link to what appears to have been a
(long-obsolete) version 5.3, and an announcement has been made of the
imminent closure of gridengine.sunsource.net.  This version hasn't
been checked against a Sun-released version with the procedure
described in doc/compatibility_test.html, and is probably not
completely compatible with any Sun/Oracle version -- definitely not on
the wire.  Thus, per section 3.1 of the SISSL, in order to use a name
like "Grid Engine" the source must be distributed, since Exhibit B
isn't applicable.  See also the explanation in
