Most of this distribution is licensed under the terms of the Sun
Industry Standards Source License; see the file SISSL.  However, code
under other licences is linked with it and some standalone programs
have other licences.  Note that the licences overall require
distributing source with any binary distribution.

If copyright notices are missing from files from the original Sun
distribution, Fritz Ferstl said at
http://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail/pkg-gridengine-devel/2007-June/000021.html
"Yes, you can assume that everything not explicitly licensed is
copyrighted by Sun and is under the SISSL."  See also

It is somewhat unclear what the effect is of the SISSL `Standards'
language.  At the time of writing (January 2011) the reference to the
"Reference Build binaries" from the relevant page on the
gridengine.sunsource.net site (dumped as file "standards" in this
directory) is a broken link to what appears to have been a
(long-obsolete) version 5.3, and an announcement has been made of the
imminent closure of gridengine.sunsource.net.  This version hasn't
been checked against a Sun-released version with the procedure
described in doc/compatibility_test.html, and is probably not
completely compatible with any Sun/Oracle version -- definitely not on
the wire.  Thus, per section 3.1 of the SISSL, in order to use a name
like "Grid Engine" the source must be distributed, since Exhibit B
isn't applicable.  See also the explanation in

Other relevant licences included in this directory are: GNU General
Public License (GPL-3), GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL-3),
GNU Free Documentation License (GFDL-3), the Berkeley Software
Distribution license (BSD), an adaptation of the FreeBSD licence
(FreeBSD), Apache License, and various specific licences for several
components.  The different files apply to the components listed below.
See the source files for detailed notices.

The hwloc, OpenSSL, and BerkeleyDB libraries are typically linked
dynamically into SGE components, and it seems customary (e.g. in
Debian, presumably following legal advice) not to list licences for
such dependencies of a program.  Nevertheless, their licence
information is provided to avoid doubt, and for convenience of anyone
distributing binaries statically linked against them.  Inline
definitions included from the hwloc header files may be significant
for copyright purposes anyway.

Apache-2: IzPack (GUI installer), jakarta-regexp (GUI installer binary)
BSD: rsh, rshd. rlogin, qtcsh
GFDL-1.3: Some documentation
GPL-3:  qmake, adoc [possibly using the "any later version" term]
LGPL-3: ListTree (qmon), pam_sge-qrsh-setup, libuti2
        [possibly using the "any later version" term] (gridengine kernel),
        Java swing-layout (GUI installer binary)
IconList, Spinbox, Xmt, XBae, XmTab: widgets used by qmon
jemalloc: jemalloc library
NanoXML: (GUI installer binary)
tango: qmon icons
top, hwloc, OpenSSL, BerkeleyDB: gridengine core
Cygwin:  binaries linked against the Cygwin library
