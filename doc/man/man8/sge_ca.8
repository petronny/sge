.SH DESCRIPTION
.I "\fBsge_ca\fP" 
controls a simple xxQS_NAMExx Certificate Authority that is used for the special Certificate Security Protocol (CSP) mode.
CSP mode improves the security behavior of xxQS_NAMExx by enabling OpenSSL secured communication channels and X509v3 certificates for authentication. In addition it is possible to export the key material or to create JKS keystores for the JMX connector.
There follows a list of possible commands and command options to give
an overview of what functionality is available. For further details about every command refer to the COMMAND DETAILS section.
.SH COMMAND OVERVIEW
.IP "\fBsge_ca [\-help]\fP"
Show usage.
.IP "\fBsge_ca \-init [command options]\fP"

.SH COMMAND DETAILS
.\"
.IP "\fBsge_ca \-init [\-cadir <dir>] [\-catop <dir>] [\-calocaltop <dir>] [\-adminuser <admin>] [\-days <num days>]\fP"
.br
The \fB\-init\fP command creates a new xxQS_NAMExx certificate authority and its corresponding files. Usually "\fBsge_ca \-init\fP" is run by user root on the master host.
If the options \-adminuser, \-cadir, \-calocaltop, \-catop are not
used and the xxQS_NAMExx environment variables SGE_ROOT, SGE_CELL and SGE_QMASTER_PORT are set, the CA directories are created in the following locations:
.br $SGE_ROOT/$SGE_CELL/common/sgeCA  (can be overruled by \-catop <dir> or \-cadir <dir>)
.br /var/sgeCA/{port$SGE_QMASTER_PORT|sge_qmaster}/$SGE_CELL  (can be overruled by \-calocaltop <dir> or \-cadir <dir>)
.br The following information must be delivered for the site:
two letter country code, state, location, e.g city or your building-code, organization (e.g. your company name), organizational unit, e.g. your department, email address of the CA administrator (you!)
.PP
Certificates and keys are generated for the CA itself, the xxQS_NAMExx daemon, install user (usually root), and finally for the admin user. 
.PP
How and where the certificates and keys are created can be influenced additionally by:
.br
.I "\fB\-days <days>\fP"
Change the time of validity of the certificates to number of <days> instead of 365 days
.br
.I "\fB\-sha1\fP"
Change the message digest algorithm from MD5 to SHA-1
.br
.I "\fB\-encryptkey\fP"
Encrypt the generated keys with a passphrase
.br
.I "\fB\-adminuser <user>\fP"
Use <user> as admin user
.br
.I "\fB\-cahost <host>\fP"
Use <host> as the CA master host
.br
.I "\fB[\-cadir <dir>] [\-catop <dir> [\-calocaltop <dir>]\fP"
Set $CATOP and $CALOCALTOP to <dir> to use something different than the xxQS_NAMExx default directories. Either \-cadir <dir> has to be specified to replace $CATOP and $CALOCALTOP by the same directory or \-catop <dir> for $CATOP and \-calocaltop <dir> for $CALOCALTOP.
.\"
.br
.IP "\fBsge_ca \-user <u:g:e> [\-cadir <dir>] [\-catop <dir>] [\-calocaltop <dir>] [\-adminuser <admin>] [\-days <days>]\fP"
Generate certificate and keys for <u:g:e> with u='Unix user account name', g='common name' and e='email address'. By default the certificate is valid for 365 days or for <days> specified with \-days <days>.
This command is usually run as user root on the qmaster host. $CATOP and $CALOCALTOP may be overruled by \-cadir, \-catop and \-calocaltop.
.\"
.IP "\fBsge_ca \-sdm_daemon <u:g:e>\fP"
Generate daemon certificate and keys for <u:g:e> with u='Unix user
account name', g='common name' and e='email address'. By default the
certificate is valid for 365 days or for <days> specified with "\fB\-days <days>\fP". This command is usually run as user root on the qmaster host.
.\"
.IP "\fBsge_ca \-usercert <user file> [\-cadir <dir>] [\-catop <dir>] [\-calocaltop <dir>] [\-adminuser <admin>] [\-days <days>] [\-encryptkey] [\-sha1]\fP"
Usually sge_ca \-usercert <user file> is run as user root on the master host. The argument <user file> contains a list of users in the following format:

.RS 0
         eddy:Eddy Smith:eddy@griders.org
.RS 0
         sarah:Sarah Miller:sarah@griders.org
.RS 0
         leo:Leo Lion:leo@griders.org
