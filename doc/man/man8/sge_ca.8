.SH DESCRIPTION
.I "\fBsge_ca\fP" 
controls a simple xxQS_NAMExx Certificate Authority that is used for the special Certificate Security Protocol (CSP) mode.
CSP mode improves the security behavior of xxQS_NAMExx by enabling OpenSSL secured communication channels and X509v3 certificates for authentication. In addition it is possible to export the key material or to create JKS keystores for the JMX connector.
There follows a list of possible commands and command options to give
an overview of what functionality is available. For further details about every command refer to the COMMAND DETAILS section.
.SH COMMAND OVERVIEW
.IP "\fBsge_ca\fP [\fB\-help\fP]"
Show usage.
.IP "\fBsge_ca \-init \fP[\fIcommand options\fP]"
Create the infrastructure for a new xxQS_NAMExx Certificate Authority
with its corresponding files and directories, and a set of keys and
certificates for the xxQS_NAMExx daemon, root and admin user.
.IP "\fBsge_ca \-req \fP|\fB \-verify \fP\fIcert\fP |\fB \-sign \fP|\fB \-copy \fP[\fIcommand options\fP]"

for the xxQS_NAMExx daemon, or the SDM daemon \fIg\fP common name,
.PP
In the above, "\fIcommand options\fP" is a combination of the following
options depending on the command. The COMMAND DETAILS section explains
which options are usable for each command.
.IP "\fB\-days\fP \fIdays\fP"
days of validity of the certificate
.IP "\fB\-sha1\fP"
Use SHA-1 instead of MD5 as message digest

.IP "\fB\-ksout\fP \fIfile\fP"
Define output file to write the keystore to
.IP "\fB\-pkcs12pwf\fP \fIfile\fP"

.IP "\fBsge_ca \-init \fP[\fB\-cadir\fP \fIdir\fP] [\fB\-catop\fP \fIdir\fP] [\fB\-calocaltop\fP \fIdir\fP] [\fB\-adminuser\fP \fIadmin\fP] [\fB\-days\fP \fInum days\fP]"
.br
The \fB\-init\fP command creates a new xxQS_NAMExx certificate authority and its corresponding files. Usually "\fBsge_ca \-init\fP" is run by user root on the master host.
If the options
.BR \-adminuser ,
.BR \-cadir ,
.BR \-calocaltop ,
and
.B \-catop
are not used, and the xxQS_NAMExx environment variables SGE_ROOT,
SGE_CELL and SGE_QMASTER_PORT are set, the CA directories are created
in the following locations:
.I $SGE_ROOT/$SGE_CELL/common/sgeCA
(can be overruled by \fB\-catop\fP \fIdir\fP or \fB\-cadir\fP \fIdir\fP)
.br
.I /var/lib/sgeCA/port$SGE_QMASTER_PORT/$SGE_CELL
or
.I /var/lib/sgeCA/sge_qmaster/$SGE_CELL
(can be overruled by \fB\-calocaltop\fP \fIdir\fP or \fB\-cadir\fP \fIdir\fP).
.br
The following information must be delivered for the site:
two letter country code, state, location, e.g. city or your building
code, organization (e.g. your company name), organizational unit,
e.g. your department, and email address of the CA administrator (you!).
.PP
Certificates and keys are generated for the CA itself, the xxQS_NAMExx
daemon, installation user (usually root), and finally for the admin
user.
.PP
How and where the certificates and keys are created can be influenced additionally by:
.IP "\fB\-days\fP \fIdays\fP"
Change the time of validity of the certificates to number of \fIdays\fP instead of 365 days
.IP "\fB\-sha1\fP"
Change the message digest algorithm from MD5 to SHA-1
.IP "\fB\-encryptkey\fP"
Encrypt the generated keys with a passphrase
.IP "\fB\-adminuser\fP \fIuser\fP"
Use \fIuser\fP as admin user
.IP "\fB\-cahost\fP \fIhost\fP"
Use \fIhost\fP as the CA master host
.IP "[\fB\-cadir\fP \fIdir\fP] [\fB\-catop\fP \fIdir\fP] [\fB\-calocaltop\fP \fIdir\fP]"
Set $CATOP and $CALOCALTOP to \fIdir\fP to use something other than
the xxQS_NAMExx default directories.  Either \fB\-cadir\fP \fIdir\fP
has to be specified to replace $CATOP and $CALOCALTOP by the same
directory or \fB\-catop\fP \fIdir\fP for $CATOP and \fB\-calocaltop\fP
\fIdir\fP for $CALOCALTOP.

.IP "\fBsge_ca \-user\fP \fIu\fP\fB:\fP\fIg\fP\fB:\fP\fIe\fP [\fB\-cadir\fP \fIdir\fP] [\fB\-catop\fP \fIdir\fP] [\fB\-calocaltop\fP \fIdir\fP] [\fB\-adminuser\fP \fIadmin\fP] [\fB\-days\fP \fIdays\fP]"
Generate user certificate and keys for \fIu\fP\fB:\fP\fIg\fP\fB:\fP\fIe\fP,
where
.I u
is the user id,
.I g
is the "common name" (real name of the user), and
.I e
is the user's email address.  By default the certificate is valid for
365 days or for \fIdays\fP, as specified with \fB\-days\fP \fIdays\fP.
This command is usually run as user root on the qmaster host. $CATOP
and $CALOCALTOP may be overruled by \fB\-cadir\fP, \fB\-catop\fP, and
\fB\-calocaltop\fP.
.\"
.IP "\fBsge_ca \-sdm_daemon\fP \fIu\fP\fB:\fP\fIg\fP\fB:\fP\fIe\fP"
Generate daemon certificate and keys for
\fIu\fP\fB:\fP\fIg\fP\fB:\fP\fIe\fP with parameters and lifetime as for
.BR \-user .
This command is usually run as user root on the qmaster host.

Usually \fBsge_ca\fP \fB\-usercert\fP \fIuser file\fP is run as user root on the master host. The argument \fIuser file\fP contains a list of users in the following format:

.RS 0
         eddy:Eddy Smith:eddy@griders.org
.RS 0
         sarah:Sarah Miller:sarah@griders.org

Renew the certificate for \fIuser\fP. By default the certificate is extended for 365 days or for \fIdays\fP specified
with \fB\-days\fP \fIdays\fP. If the value is negative the certificate becomes invalid.
