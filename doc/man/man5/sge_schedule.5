.TH sge_schedule 5 2012-07-25
.SH NAME
sge_schedule \- format of the xxQS_NAMExx schedule file
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I schedule
File is written by the qmaster when
.B MONITOR=1
is set in the
.B params
item of
.M sched_conf 5 .
.PP
Note that the file tends to grow rapidly, and should be
truncated/rotated, e.g. with
.M logrotate 1 .
Also it should probably be placed on local disk, not an NFS-mounted
filesystem, for instance, because of the large number of small writes
it typically gets \- e.g. make a symbolic link into the qmaster spool
area (assuming that is local).
.PP
See
.M qsched 1
for a tool to process the data and produce information on reservations.
