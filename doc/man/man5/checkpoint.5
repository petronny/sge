.TH CHECKPOINT 5 "2012-01-07" "xxRELxx" "xxQS_NAMExx File Formats"
.\"
.SH NAME
checkpoint \- xxQS_NAMExx checkpointing environment configuration file format
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
Checkpointing is a facility to save the complete status of an executing
program or job and to restore and restart from this so-called checkpoint
at a later point of time if the original program or job was halted, e.g.
through a system crash.
.PP
xxQS_NAMExx provides various levels of checkpointing support (see
.M xxqs_name_sxx_ckpt 1 ).
The checkpointing environment described here is a means to configure
the different types of checkpointing in use for your xxQS_NAMExx cluster or
parts thereof. For that purpose you can define the operations which
have to be executed in initiating a checkpoint generation, a migration
of a checkpoint to another host, or a restart of a checkpointed
application, as well as the list of queues which are eligible for a
checkpointing method.
.PP
Supporting different operating systems may easily force xxQS_NAMExx to 
introduce operating system dependencies for the configuration of the 
checkpointing configuration file and updates of the supported operating 
system versions may lead to frequently changing implementation details. 
Please refer to the <xxqs_name_sxx_root>/ckpt directory for more 
information.
.PP
Please use the \fI\-ackpt\fP, \fI\-dckpt\fP, \fI\-mckpt\fP or \fI\-sckpt\fP
options to the
.M qconf 1
command to manipulate checkpointing environments from the command-line or
use the corresponding
.M qmon 1
dialogue for X-Windows based interactive configuration.
.PP
Note, xxQS_NAMExx allows backslashes (\\) be used to escape newline
characters. The backslash and the newline are replaced with a space
character before any interpretation.

.SH FORMAT
The format of a
.I checkpoint
file is defined as follows:
.SS "\fBckpt_name\fP"
The name of the checkpointing environment in the format for \fIckpt_name\fP in
.M sge_types 1 .
To be used in the
.M qsub 1
\fB\-ckpt\fP switch or for the
.M qconf 1
options mentioned above.
.SS "\fBinterface\fP"
The type of checkpointing to be used. Currently, the following types are
valid:
.IP "\fIhibernator\fP"
The Hibernator kernel level checkpointing is interfaced.
.IP "\fIcpr\fP"
The SGI kernel level checkpointing is used.
.IP "\fItransparent\fP"
xxQS_NAMExx assumes that the jobs submitted with reference to this checkpointing
interface use a checkpointing library such as provided by 
the free package \fICondor\fP.
.IP "\fIuserdefined\fP"
xxQS_NAMExx assumes that the jobs submitted with reference to this checkpointing
interface perform their private checkpointing method.
.IP "\fIapplication-level\fP"
Uses all of the interface commands configured in the checkpointing object
like in the case of one of the kernel level checkpointing interfaces
(\fIcpr\fP, etc.) except for the
.B restart_command
(see below), which is not
used (even if it is configured) but the job script is invoked in case of a
restart instead.
.SS "\fBckpt_command\fP"
A command-line type command string to be executed by xxQS_NAMExx in order to
initiate a checkpoint.  The following pseudo-variables are available to be
substituted in the value:
.\" fixme: explain them
.IP \fB$host\fP
.IP \fB$job_owner\fP
.IP \fB$job_id\fP
.IP \fB$job_name\fP
.IP \fB$queue\fP
.IP \fB$job_pid\fP
.IP \fB$ckpt_dir\fP
.IP \fB$ckpt_signal\fP
.SS "\fBmigr_command\fP"
A command-line type command string to be executed by xxQS_NAMExx during a
migration of a checkpointing job from one host to another.  The same
pseudo-variables are available as for \fBckpt_command\fP.
.SS "\fBrestart_command\fP"
A command-line type command string to be executed by xxQS_NAMExx when restarting
a previously checkpointed application.  The same
pseudo-variables are available as for \fBckpt_command\fP.
.SS "\fBclean_command\fP"
A command-line type command string to be executed by xxQS_NAMExx in order
to cleanup after a checkpointed application has finished.  The same
pseudo-variables are available as for \fBckpt_command\fP.
.SS "\fBckpt_dir\fP"
A file system location to which checkpoints of potentially considerable
size should be stored.
.SS "\fBckpt_signal\fP"
A Unix signal to be sent to a job by xxQS_NAMExx to initiate checkpoint
generation. The value for this field can either be a symbolic name from the
list produced by the \fI\-l\fP option of the
.M kill 1
command or an integer number which must be a valid signal on the systems
used for checkpointing.
.SS "\fBwhen\fP"
The points of time when checkpoints are expected to be generated.
Valid values for this parameter are composed from the letters \fIs\fP,
\fIm\fP,
\fIx\fP,
\fIr\fP and
any combinations thereof without any separating character in between. The
same letters are allowed for the \fI\-c\fP option of the
.M qsub 1
command which will overwrite the definitions in the used checkpointing
environment.
The meaning of the letters is defined as follows:
.IP "\fIs\fP"
A job is checkpointed, aborted and if possible migrated if the
corresponding
.M xxqs_name_sxx_execd 8
is shut down on the job's machine.
.IP "\fIm\fP"
Checkpoints are generated periodically at the \fImin_cpu_interval\fP
interval defined by the queue (see
.M queue_conf 5 )
in which a job executes.
.IP "\fIx\fP"
A job is checkpointed, aborted and, if possible, migrated as soon as the job
gets suspended (manually as well as automatically).
.IP "\fIr\fP"
A job will be rescheduled (not checkpointed) when the host on which the job
currently runs went into the "unknown" state and the time interval
\fIreschedule_unknown\fP (see
.M xxqs_name_sxx_conf 5 )
defined in the global/local cluster configuration is exceeded.
.\"
.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
\fBxxQS_NAME_Sxx_BINDING\fP and \fBxxQS_NAME_Sxx_CKPT_DIR\fP may be
specified on job submission.  See
.M submit 1 .
.\"
.\"
.SH RESTRICTIONS
\fBNote\fP that the functionality of any checkpointing,
migration or restart procedures provided by default with
the xxQS_NAMExx distribution, as well as the way how they are invoked in
the \fIckpt_command\fP, \fImigr_command\fP or \fIrestart_command\fP
parameters of any default checkpointing environments, should not be
changed; otherwise the functionality remains the full responsibility
of the administrator configuring the checkpointing environment.
xxQS_NAMExx will just invoke these procedures and evaluate their
exit status. If the procedures do not perform their tasks
properly, or are not invoked in a proper fashion, the checkpointing
mechanism may behave unexpectedly; xxQS_NAMExx has no means to detect this.
