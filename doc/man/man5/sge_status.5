.SS "\"Failed\" states"
The following table lists the "failed" values reported by
.M qacct 1
(see 
.M accounting 5 ),
their description, also reported by
.IR qacct ,
whether the resource usage accounting data are valid for the job
("OK"), and an explanation.  The host's messages file or the shepherd
trace file (preserved with
.B execd_params
.B KEEP_ACTIVE
in
.M sge_conf 5 )
may provide more information about errors.
