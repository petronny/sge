.SH NAME
reporting \- xxQS_NAMExx reporting file format
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
A xxQS_NAMExx system writes a reporting file
.I $SGE_ROOT/$SGE_CELL/common/reporting
if
.B reporting=true
is specified in the
.M sge_conf 5
.BR reporting_params .
This occurs intervals of the
.B flush_time
specified in the same place.
The reporting file contains data that can be used for accounting, monitoring and analysis purposes.
It contains information about the cluster (hosts, queues, load values, consumables, etc.), about the jobs running in the cluster and about sharetree configuration and usage.
All information is time-related and events are dumped to the reporting file in a configurable interval.
It allows "real time" monitoring of the cluster status as well as historical analysis.
.\"
.\"
.SH FORMAT
The reporting file is an ASCII file.
Each line contains one record, and the fields of a record are separated by a delimiter (:).
The reporting file contains records of different type. Each record type has a specific record structure. 
.PP
The first two fields are common to all reporting records:
.IP "\fBtime\fP"
The time when the record was created.  All time values described here
are the number of seconds since the Unix epoch (1970-01-01 00:00:00
UTC).
.IP "\fBrecord type\fP"
Type of the accounting record.
.PP
The different types of records and their structure are described
below, eliding the leading \fBtime\fP and \fBrecord type\fP fields in
each case.
.SS new_job
The new_job record is written whenever a new job enters the system (usually by a submission command). It has the following fields:
.IP "\fBsubmission_time\fP"
Time when the job was submitted.
.IP "\fBjob_number\fP"
The job number.
.IP "\fBtask_number\fP"
The array task id. Always has the value \-1 for new_job records (as
array tasks haven't been created at that stage).
.IP "\fBpe_taskid\fP"
The task id of parallel tasks. Always has the value "none" for new_job records.
.IP "\fBjob_name\fP"
The job name (from \fB\-N\fP submission option).
.IP "\fBowner\fP"
The job owner.
.IP "\fBgroup\fP"
The Unix group of the job owner.
.IP "\fBproject\fP"
The project the job is running in.
.IP "\fBdepartment\fP"
The department the job owner is in.
.IP "\fBaccount\fP"
The account string specified for the job (from the \fB\-A\fP submission option).
.IP "\fBpriority\fP"
The job priority (from the \fB\-p\fP submission option).
.SS job_log
If
.B joblog=true
is specified in the
.M sge_conf 5
.BR reporting_params ,
a job_log record is written whenever a job, an array task or a PE
task changes status. A status change can be the transition from
pending to running, but can also be triggered by user actions, like
suspension of a job.  It has the following fields:
.IP "\fBevent_time\fP"
Time when the event was generated.
.IP "\fBevent\fP"
A one word description of the event.
.IP "\fBjob_number\fP"
The job number.
.IP "\fBtask_number\fP"
The PE task id. Always has the value \-1 for new_job records (as
parallel tasks haven't been created at that stage).
.IP "\fBpe_taskid\fP"
The task id of parallel tasks. Always has the value "none" for new_job records.
.IP "\fBstate\fP"
The state of the job after the event was processed.
.IP "\fBuser\fP"
.\" Fixme:  is "scheduler" still produced?
The user who initiated the event (or special usernames "qmaster", "scheduler" 
and "execd" for actions of the system itself like scheduling jobs, executing jobs etc.).
.IP "\fBhost\fP"
The host from which the action was initiated (e.g. the submit host, the qmaster host, etc.).
.IP "\fBstate_time\fP"
Reserved field for later use.
.IP "\fBsubmission_time\fP"
Time when the job was submitted.
.IP "\fBjob_name\fP"
The job name (from the \fB\-N\fP submission option).
.IP "\fBowner\fP"
The job owner.
.IP "\fBgroup\fP"
The Unix group of the job owner.
.IP "\fBproject\fP"
The project the job is running in.
.IP "\fBdepartment\fP"
The department the job owner is in.
.IP "\fBaccount\fP"
The account string specified for the job (from the \fB\-A\fP submission option).
.IP "\fBpriority\fP"
The job priority (from the \fB\-p\fP submission option).
.IP "\fBmessage\fP"
A message describing the reported action.
.SS acct
Records of type acct are accounting records. Normally, they are written whenever a job, a task of an array job, 
or a task of a parallel job terminates. However, for long running jobs an intermediate acct record is created once a
day after midnight. This results in multiple accounting records for a particular job and allows for fine-grained
resource usage monitoring over time. 
.PP
Accounting records have the structure described in
.M accounting 5 ,
with the addition the leading time and type fields (which are not used
in the accounting file).
.SS queue
Records of type queue contain state information for queues (queue instances).
A queue record has the following fields:
.IP "\fBqname\fP"
The cluster queue name.
.IP "\fBhostname\fP"
The hostname of a specific queue instance.
.IP "\fBreport_time\fP"
The time when a state change was triggered.
.IP "\fBstate\fP"
The new queue state.
The possible states are single-letter values, as reported
by
.M qhost 1
with the
.B \-q
option.
.SS queue_consumable
A queue_consumable record contains information about queue consumable values in addition to queue state information:
.IP "\fBqname\fP"
The cluster queue name.
.IP "\fBhostname\fP"
The hostname of a specific queue instance.
.IP "\fBreport_time\fP"
The time when a state change was triggered.
.IP "\fBstate\fP"
The new queue state.
.IP "\fBconsumables\fP"
Description of consumable values. Information about multiple consumables is separated by space.
A consumable description has the format <name>=<actual_value>=<configured value>.
.PP
Consumables are only logged if
.B log_consumables=true
is specified in the
.M sge_conf 5
.BR reporting_params ,
or the consumable is specified in the local or global
.M host_conf 5
.BR report_variables .
.SS host
A host record contains information about hosts and host load values.
It contains the following information:
.IP "\fBhostname\fP"
The name of the host.
.IP "\fBreport_time\fP"
The time when the reported information was generated.
.IP "\fBstate\fP"
The new host state.
Currently, xxQS_NAMExx doesn't track a host state; the field is reserved for
future use. Always contains the value X.
.IP "\fBload values\fP"
Description of load values. Information about multiple load values is separated by space.
A load value description has the format <name>=<actual_value>.
.\"
.SS host_consumable
A host_consumable record contains information about hosts and host consumables.
Host consumables can, for example, be licenses.
It contains the following information:

The name of the host.
.IP "\fBreport_time\fP"
The time when the reported information was generated.
.IP "\fBstate\fP"
The new host state.
Currently, xxQS_NAMExx doesn't track a host state; the field is reserved for
future use. Always contains the value X.
.IP "\fBconsumables\fP"
Description of consumable values. Information about multiple consumables is separated by space.
A consumable description has the format <name>=<actual_value>=<configured value>.
.PP
Consumables are only logged if
.B log_consumables=true
is specified in the
.M sge_conf 5
.BR reporting_params ,
or the consumable is specified in the local or global
.M host_conf 5
.BR report_variables .
.SS sharelog 
The xxQS_NAMExx qmaster can dump information about sharetree configuration and use to the reporting file.
The
.M sge_conf 5
.B reporting_params
can specify \fBsharelog\fP, which sets an interval in which sharetree
information will be dumped.
It is set in the format HH:MM:SS. A value of 00:00:00 configures qmaster not to
dump sharetree information. Intervals of several minutes up to hours are sensible values for this parameter.
