.SH NAME
xxqs_name_sxx_ckpt \- the xxQS_NAMExx checkpointing mechanism and checkpointing
support
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
xxQS_NAMExx
supports two levels of checkpointing: the user level and an operating
system-provided transparent
level. User level checkpointing refers to applications which do their
own checkpointing by writing restart files at certain times or
algorithmic steps and by properly processing these restart files when
restarted.
.PP
Transparent checkpointing has to be provided by the operating system and is 
usually integrated in the operating system kernel. An example for a kernel 
integrated checkpointing facility is the Hibernator package from Softway
for SGI IRIX platforms.
.PP
Checkpointing jobs need to be identified to the xxQS_NAMExx system by using the 
\fI\-ckpt\fP option of the
.M qsub 1
command. The argument to this flag refers to a so 
called checkpointing environment, which defines the attributes of the 
checkpointing method to be used (see
.M checkpoint 5
for details). 
Checkpointing environments are setup by the
.M qconf 1
options \fI\-ackpt\fP, \fI\-dckpt\fP, \fI\-mckpt\fP and \fI\-sckpt\fP. The
.M qsub 1
option \fI\-c\fP can be used to overwrite the \fIwhen\fP
attribute for the referenced checkpointing environment.
.PP
As opposed to the behavior for
regular batch jobs, checkpointing jobs (see the \fB\-ckpt\fP option to
.M qsub 1 )
are aborted under conditions
for which batch or interactive jobs are suspended or even stay
unaffected. These conditions are:
.\"
.IP "\(bu" 3n
Explicit suspension of the queue or job via
.M qmod 1
by the cluster administration or a queue owner
if the \fIx\fP occasion specifier (see
.M qsub 1
\fI\-c\fP and 
.M checkpoint 5 )
was assigned to the job.
.\"
.IP "\(bu" 3n
A load average value exceeding the suspend threshold as configured for
the corresponding queues (see
.M queue_conf 5 ).
.\"
.IP "\(bu" 3n
Shutdown of the xxQS_NAMExx execution daemon
.M xxqs_name_sxx_execd 8
being responsible for the checkpointing job.
.PP
.\"
After they are aborted, jobs will migrate to other hosts, and possibly
other cluster queues, unless they were
submitted to a specific one by an explicit user request.
The migration of jobs leads to a dynamic load balancing.
\fBNote:\fP Aborting checkpointed jobs will free all resources
(memory, swap space) which the job occupies at that time. This is
opposed to the situation for suspended regular jobs, which still use
virtual memory and other consumable resources.
.PP
.\"
.\"
.SH RESTRICTIONS
When a job migrates to another machine, at present no files
are transferred automatically to that machine. This means that all files
which are used throughout the entire job, including restart files,
executables, and scratch files, must be visible or transferred explicitly
(e.g. at the beginning of the job script).
.PP
.\"
There are also some practical limitations regarding use of disk space
for transparently checkpointing jobs. Checkpoints of a transparently
checkpointed application are usually stored in a checkpoint file or
directory by the operating system. The file or directory contains all
the text, data, and stack space for the process, along with some
additional control information. This means jobs which use a very large
virtual address space will generate very large checkpoint files. Also
the workstations on which the jobs will actually execute may have
little free disk space. Thus it is not always possible to transfer a
transparent checkpointing job to a machine, even though that machine is
idle. Since large virtual memory jobs must wait for a machine that is
both idle, and has a sufficient amount of free disk space, such jobs
may suffer long turnaround times.
.PP
There is no mechanism for restarting jobs with the same resources they
were granted to run in, which might be important if they were
submitted with a choice or range of resources and start running in a
particular way with what they're given.
.PP
Similarly, with heterogeneous execution hosts, jobs may need to
restart on a host which supports a superset of the instruction set
where the job originally ran if the checkpoint mechanism (e.g. BLCR or
DMTCP) dumps an image of the running process.  Runtime libraries, in
particular, may initialize themselves depending on details of the
architecture they start up on \- say to use a specific type of vector
unit.  Then, they may fail if moved to an older host of similar
architecture which lacks that feature, even if they were compiled for
a common instruction set.
