# Example host aliase configuration file; see host_aliases(5).

# cluster-head.example.com is the external DNS name of the head, which
# is used in $SGE_ROOT/$SGE_CELL/common/act_qmaster.  Its
# cluster-internal interface is on 10.0.0.2, and it may also be known
# as head.local.  SGE components will canonicalize addresses in the
# aliases list to "head" (the first value in the list) if their normal
# host lookup matches any of the names for this host.  The commas can
# be replaced by spaces -- they only help distinguish the alias list
# from the canonical name.
