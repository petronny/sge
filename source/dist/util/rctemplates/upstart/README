These are trivial example service files for starting SGE daemons with
the "upstart" init replacement.  You don't actually need them, since
upstart supports LSB-compliant init files, and they're less
sophisticated than the templates in the directory above.  Note that
stopping (re-starting) the execd service will kill running jobs.

They assume that sourcing /etc/default/{sgemaster,sgeexecd} sets
SGE_ROOT and SGE_CELL.
