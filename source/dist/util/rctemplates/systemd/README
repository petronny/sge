These are trivial example service files for starting SGE daemons with
the "systemd" init replacement.  You don't actually need them, since
systemd supports LSB-compliant init files, and they're less
sophisticated than the templates in the directory above.  Note that
stopping (re-starting) the execd service will kill running jobs.

They assume that sourcing /etc/sysconfig/sge sets SGE_ROOT and
SGE_CELL.  (I don't think you can use common/settings.sh.)
