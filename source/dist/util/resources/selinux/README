These SELinux policy files are taken from RHEL 7's
selinux-policy-targeted package with sge.fc adjusted for paths under
/opt.

On an RHEL/Fedora system, I think you can install them as follows:*
Install policycoreutils-python setools-console selinux-policy-devel
with yum/dnf, and in this directory do as root:

  make -f /usr/share/selinux/devel/Makefile DISTRO=rhel7
  semodule -i splunk.pp
  fixfiles restore /opt

The Debian handbook has information for SELinux on Debian-based
systems.

The file labelling may not work for /opt on a networked filesystem.
Specifically, an NFS server will need to be configured for SELinux
support -- see the relevant system administrative documentation.
