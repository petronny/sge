                              status script

This archive contains a shell script, which makes heavy use of awk. The purpose
is to beautify the output of the qstat command under SGE 5.x/6.x. The script is
uniform for both versions of SGE.

For the -r option to work you will need gawk version 3.1.6 or higher. Unfortunately
there seems no "--version" option to be available across different operating
system's provided "awk", hence it can't be tested at runtime.

For a full explanation please have a look at the help page of status, which can
be accessed by "status -h".

Just copy it to any directory you like on your system which is in your search
path.

Under Solaris the awk used by the script must be the POSIX variant, which is
located unter /usr/xpg4/bin. The script tries to get the used OS and set
the awk command accordingly. If the necessary version of awk is in an other
directory, please set at the beginning of the script the value of $awk_command
to the correct one.
