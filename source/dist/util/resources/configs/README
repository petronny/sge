Configuration files to help SGE fit into other infrastructure.

logcheck.sge:  Filter information and warning syslog messages with
               logcheck(8), which appear at execd startup even if
               USE_SYSLOG is false.  Install it, for instance, as
               /etc/logcheck/ignore.d.server/sge

logrotate.sge:  Rotate log files with logrotate(1)
