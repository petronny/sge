         Scali MPI integration with Grid Engine
         ======================================

[This refers to what became HP MPI and then Platform MPI.  It may or
may not still be relevant -- feedback welcome.  HP MPI can be tightly
integrated via MPI_REMSH in the environment.  See the notes at
<http://wiki.gridengine.info/wiki/index.php/Tight-HP-MPI-Integration-Notes>,
though they make rather a meal of it.]

For Scali MPI based parallel jobs the scripts Scali_Suspend.sh 
and Scali_Resume.sh can be used as suspend_method/resume_method
as explained in Grid Engine man page queue_conf(5).

These scripts forward the appropriate signals to the controlling Scali
process.

In the queue configuration use something like

 suspend_method         /sge-root/Scali-MPI/Scali_Suspend.sh $job_pid
 resume_method         /sge-root/Scali-MPI/Scali_Resume.sh

You can suspend and resume using

 qmod -sj wc_job_range_list
 qmod -usj wc_job_range_list

It is also possible to set up subordinate queue relationships to cause 
suspension of jobs.

Note that the suspended job still holds OS resources.

This version (v1.1) is an update by Harvey Richardson to make the scripts
more robust.

Revisions of these scripts have been tested on various OS (Linux/Solaris) 
and Scali versions, the most recent being SLES10sp2 with Scali MPI Connect 
5.6.6.

Feedback (to sge-bugs@liv.ac.uk) and enhancements of this
integration are highly welcome.
