What it does:
-------------

This package should give the grid engine batch system control over
interactive jobs started by qrsh.

Two things are done:
	1. the group id coming from
	   $SGE_ROOT/default/spool/<hostname>/active_jobs/<job_id>/addgrpid
	   will be set
	2. the environmen coming from
	   $SGE_ROOT/default/spool/<hostname>/active_jobs/<job_id>/environment
	   will be set as well

How to setup:
-------------

	1. install rshd-wrapper somewhere
	2. set rlogin_daemon, rsh_daemon to /path/to/rshd-wrapper in the GE
	   configuration (qconf -mconf global),
	   rsh_command, rlogin_command are still set to "ssh -tt"
	3. compile pam_sge-qrsh-setup.c
	   (gcc -o pam_sge-qrsh-setup.so -shared pam_sge-qrsh-setup.c)
	4. install pam_sge-qrsh-setup.so on an execution host
	5. modify /etc/pam.d/sshd so that it contain the following line:
	   auth required pam_sge-qrsh-setup.so
	6. do qrsh -l h=<exec host> and have a look at the output of "id" and
	   "printenv" ;-)
