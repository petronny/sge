1) Purpose
----------

This package is a proposal for a complet replacement for the icon set used by the QMON application part of 
GridEngine 6.2u5


2) History
----------

After seeing the following issue in the gridengine tracker database:

  Issue 2623 : qmon icons are terrifyingly bad
  http://gridengine.sunsource.net/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=2623

I decided to give a try at finding a valid replacement for QMON icons. 

To keep the UI consistent and remove any licensing issues, I've settle on only using icons from the Tango 
Desktop Project (version 0.8.90) as suggested in the issue report. 

Unfortunately the Tango icon doesn't provide all the needed icons for QMON and I had to create a couple of 
new ones. Overall, 70% of the icons came untouch from the Tango library, 15% came from the Tango library 
but have been modified and 15% are completly new.

Gimp 2.6 and Inskape 0.46 were used to developp these icons using either the .svg or .png files provided 
in the Tango library.


3) Terms of Use 
---------------

This icons package is release to the public domain. It's base on the icons from the Tango Desktop
Project 0.8.90 which is part of the public domain. There is not licensing restriction in using this 
package.

More information about the Tango Desktop Project can be found at:

  http://tango.freedesktop.org/Tango_Desktop_Project


4) Compatiblity
---------------

This icon package have been tested on Linux and Solaris for GE version 6.0, 6.1 and 6.2u5.
The package should be compatible with all 6.x versions of GE on any platform. Please note some 
included icons are only be accessible with GE 6.1 or 6.2.


5) Preview
----------

You can preview and compare all the provided icons by opening the included HTML file preview.html

In it, you will a side-to-side comparison between the current and proposed icons, accompanied 
by comments an references to original Tango library icons.


6) Installation
---------------

QMON icons are loaded at runtime and can therefore be changed without having to recompile or 
reinstall the GE binaries.

The QMON icons are located in the directory:

  $SGE_ROOT/qmon/PIXMAPS
  
To use the proposed icon package, replace the central PIXMAPS directory with the PIXMAPS directory 
included in this package (you should keep the original PIXMAPS directory as a backup)

Once the icons have been replaced, you just need to restart QMON to start using them.



6) Icons format
---------------

QMON support icon in the XPM format (X PixMap). XPM is an ASCII-text-based image format used by the 
X Window System.

QMON only support 256 colors XPM. Transparency is enabled in the two ways:

  Using the default transparent colorname (when background color is #)
  c None
    
  Using a symbolic name for the transparent colorname (when background color is #)
  s mask c None


The XPM format doesn't support alphablending with transparency. Because of this, hard edge can appear 
when the icon transition to the background color. With the original icon set, this type of artifact 
was very visible.

To remove the hard edge, all the semi-transparent icon edge have been blended with the expected background 
color. This way, the icons now have a smooth transition with the background color. 




7) Obsolete icons
----------------

Some icons are not longer in use. While some are still being instantiated in the QMON code, I haven't 
seen any actual use for them. Here is the list of icon I think are obsolete:

   head_open.png
   leaf_minus.png
   leaf_plus.png
   xterm-blank.png 
   xterm-axp.png   
   xterm-cray.png  
   xterm-dec.png   
   xterm-hp.png    
   xterm-ibm.png   
   xterm-linux.png 
   xterm-sgi1.png  
   xterm-sgi.png   
   xterm-sol.png   
   xterm-sun.png   
   xterm.png     
   unknown.xpm  
   binary_on_ins.png
   qsh_on_ins.png
   qsh_off_ins.png

Also, some icons still in use have become duplicate and could be remove from the code

   leaf_open.png        same as  leaf.png
   peconf.png           same as  toolbar_pe.png
   

Please note that while these icons are consider obsolete, a new version was still created for them.
   
Finaly, some icons felt no longer pertinent and have been replaced them with a blank icon to keep 
compatibility for existing QMON binary

   memorybig.png
   days.png
   hours.png
   minutes.png
   seconds.png

These icons have become obsolete and could remove from the code.  


8) Insensitive icons
--------------------

An insensitive icon is use to represent a disabled or unusable functionality. It's normaly
a gray-out and/or dim copy from the original icon.

In QMON, several icons have insensitive version named with the suffix '_ins'. In parallel, 
QMON also make use of the API functionality to render insensitive icon using the original icon.

You can see the API effect in the panel 'General Configuration' of the 'Cluster Queues->Modify' window.
When a feature is locked, its corresponding icon and text are automatically gray out by the API.

I suggest we should use the API insensitive method where pertinent for icons that need to become 
insensitive instead of supporting a dedicated set of insensitive icons. This way, the insentive
icons would have a uniform look and also it would reduce the workload of creating and maintaining 
additional insentive icons.

The following icons could be removed and replaced by the API insentive method

   21cal_ins.png  
   deadline_ins.png  
   mailbox_ins.png  
   project_ins.png  
   script_file_ins.png  
   stderror_ins.png  
   stdinput_ins.png  
   stdoutput_ins.png  
  
Only the 2 followings icons would be better rendered using their current insensitive icon:

   open_lock_insensitive.png  
   binary_off_ins.png


9) Big toolbar icons
--------------------

The QMON toolbar can use big icon (64x64 pixels) instead of the default normal icon (32x32 pixels). 
To do so, you need to recompile QMON application by changing the 'Qmon*pixmapFilePath' variable in the 
qmon_main.ad file.
