qtcsh is an extension of the popular csh derivative tcsh 
allowing transparent remote execution using Grid Engine.

It is based on tcsh v6.17.00 whose copyright notice can
be found in the file 'Copyright'. The copyright notice
of csh can be found in 'copyright.csh'.  Some irrelevant files
have been removed that weren't in the original 6.09-based version,
specifically the "win32", "test", and non-"C" nls directories, and
tcsh.vcproj.  (make check is broken anyway with recent versions of
GNU m4.)

For additional information and usage see the manpage qtcsh(1)
respectively tcsh(1).

At least the following files were noted by Sun as modified for Grid Engine:
config.sub,Makefile.in,configure,ed.h,sh.c,sh.err.c,sh.exec.c,sh.h,
sh.init.c,tc.alloc.c,tc.os.h,tc.sig.h,tc.vers.c
