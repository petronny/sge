.SH NAME
hostgroup \- host group entry file format
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
A host group entry is used to merge host names to groups.
Each  host  group  entry  file defines one group. Inside a
group definition file you can also reference groups. These
groups are called subgroups. A subgroup is referenced by the
sign "@" as first character of the name.
.PP
A list of currently-configured host group entries can be displayed
via the
.M qconf 1
\fB\-shgrpl\fP option. The contents of each listed host group entry 
can be
shown via the \fB\-shgrp\fP switch. The output follows the
.I hostgroup
format description. New host group entries can be created and existing can be
modified via the \fB\-ahgrp\fP, \fB\-mhgrp\fP, \fB\-dhgrp\fP and 
\fB\-?attr\fP options to
.M qconf 1 .
.PP
Note, Grid Engine allows backslashes (\\) be used to escape newline
characters. The backslash and the newline are replaced with a space
character before any interpretation.
.\"
.\"
.SH FORMAT
A host group entry contains the following parameters:
.SS "\fBgroup_name\fP"
The group_name defines the host group name. Host group names have to
begin with an '@' character as explained for \fIhostgroup_name\fP in
.M sge_types 5 .
.SS "\fBhostlist\fP"
The names of all hosts and host groups (see
\fIhost_identifier\fP in 
.M sge_types 1 )
which are members of the group.  Only whitespace is allowed as list
separators. The default value for this parameter is NONE.
.PP
Note, if the first character of the \fIhost_identifier\fP is an "@" sign the name 
is used to reference a 
.M hostgroup 5 
which is taken as a subgroup of this group.
.\"
.\"

.SH EXAMPLE
This is a typical host group entry:

.PP
group_name @bigMachines
.PP
hostlist @solaris64 @solaris32 fangorn balrog
.PP

The entry will define a new host group called 
\fB@bigMachines\fP. In this host group are the host 
\fBfangorn\fP, \fBbalrog\fP and all members of the host groups 
\fB@solaris64\fP and \fB@solaris32\fP.
