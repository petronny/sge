.TH QTASK 5 "$Date: 2005-03-30 14:31:37 $" "SGE 8.0.0" "Grid Engine File Formats"
.\"
.SH NAME
qtask \- file format of the qtask file.
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
A
.I qtask
file defines which commands are submitted
to Grid Engine for remote execution by
.M qtcsh 1 .
The
.I qtask 
file optionally may contain
.M qrsh 1
command-line parameters. These parameters are passed to the
.M qrsh 1
command being used by
.I qtcsh
to submit the commands.
.PP
Both a cluster global
.I qtask
file defining cluster wide defaults, and a user specific
.I qtask
file eventually overriding and enhancing those definitions, are
supported. The cluster global file resides at
<sge_root>/<cell/common/qtask, while the user specific file
can be found at ~/.qtask. An exclamation mark preceding command
definitions in the cluster global file can be used by the administrator to
deny overriding of such commands by users.
.\"
.\"
.SH FORMAT
The overall format of the
.I qtask
file is that of
a tabulated list. Each line starting with a '#' character
is a comment line. Each non-comment line defines
a command to be started remotely.
.sp 1
Definition starts with the command name that must match exactly the name as
typed in a
.M qtcsh 1
command-line. Pathnames are not allowed in
.I qtask
files. Hence absolute or relative pathnames in
.M qtcsh 1
command-lines always lead to local execution, even if the command itself
is the same as defined in the
.I qtask
file.
.sp 1
The command name can be followed by an arbitrary number of
.M qrsh 1
option arguments which are passed on to
.M qrsh 1
by
.M qtcsh 1 .
.sp 1
An exclamation mark
prefixing the command in the cluster global
.I qtask
file prevents overriding by the user supplied
.I qtask
file.
.\"
.\"
.SH EXAMPLES
.\"
The following
.I qtask
file
.sp 1
.nf
.RS
firefox -l a=sol-sparc64 -v DISPLAY=myhost:0
grep -l h=filesurfer
verilog -l veri_lic=1
.RE
.fi
.sp 1
designates the applications firefox, grep and verilog for interactive
remote execution through Grid Engine. Firefox is requested to run only
on Solaris64 architectures with the DISPLAY environment variable set
to 'myhost:0', grep only runs on the host named 'filesurfer', and verilog
requests availability of a verilog license in order to get executed
remotely.
