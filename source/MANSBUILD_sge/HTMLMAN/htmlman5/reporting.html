<H2>NAME</H2><PRE>
       reporting - Grid Engine reporting file format


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       A Grid Engine system writes a reporting file
       <I>$SGE</I><B>_</B><I>ROOT/$SGE</I><B>_</B><I>CELL/common/reporting</I> if <B>reporting=true</B> is specified in
       the <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_conf.html">sge_conf(5)</A></B> <B>reporting_params</B>.  This occurs intervals of the
       <B>flush_time</B> specified in the same place.  The reporting file contains
       data that can be used for accounting, monitoring and analysis purposes.
       It contains information about the cluster (hosts, queues, load values,
       consumables, etc.), about the jobs running in the cluster and about
       sharetree configuration and usage.  All information is time-related and
       events are dumped to the reporting file in a configurable interval.  It
       allows "real time" monitoring of the cluster status as well as
       historical analysis.


</PRE>
<H2>FORMAT</H2><PRE>
       The reporting file is an ASCII file.  Each line contains one record,
       and the fields of a record are separated by a delimiter (:).  The
       reporting file contains records of different type. Each record type has
       a specific record structure.

       The first two fields are common to all reporting records:

       <B>time</B>   The time when the record was created.  All time values described
              here are the number of seconds since the Unix epoch (1970-01-01
              00:00:00 UTC).

       <B>record</B> <B>type</B>
              Type of the accounting record.

       The different types of records and their structure are described below,
       eliding the leading <B>time</B> and <B>record</B> <B>type</B> fields in each case.

   <B>new_job</B>
       The new_job record is written whenever a new job enters the system
       (usually by a submission command). It has the following fields:

       <B>submission_time</B>
              Time when the job was submitted.

       <B>job_number</B>
              The job number.

       <B>task_number</B>
              The array task id. Always has the value -1 for new_job records
              (as array tasks haven't been created at that stage).

       <B>pe_taskid</B>
              The task id of parallel tasks. Always has the value "none" for
              new_job records.

       <B>job_name</B>
              The job name (from <B>-N</B> submission option).

       <B>owner</B>  The job owner.

       <B>group</B>  The Unix group of the job owner.

       <B>project</B>
              The project the job is running in.

       <B>department</B>
              The department the job owner is in.

       <B>account</B>
              The account string specified for the job (from the <B>-A</B> submission
              option).

       <B>priority</B>
              The job priority (from the <B>-p</B> submission option).

   <B>job_log</B>
       If <B>joblog=true</B> is specified in the <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_conf.html">sge_conf(5)</A></B> <B>reporting_params</B>, a
       job_log record is written whenever a job, an array task or a PE task
       changes status. A status change can be the transition from pending to
       running, but can also be triggered by user actions, like suspension of
       a job.  It has the following fields:

       <B>event_time</B>
              Time when the event was generated.

       <B>event</B>  A one word description of the event.

       <B>job_number</B>
              The job number.

       <B>task_number</B>
              The PE task id. Always has the value -1 for new_job records (as
              parallel tasks haven't been created at that stage).

       <B>pe_taskid</B>
              The task id of parallel tasks. Always has the value "none" for
              new_job records.

       <B>state</B>  The state of the job after the event was processed.

       <B>user</B>   The user who initiated the event (or special usernames
              "qmaster", "scheduler" and "execd" for actions of the system
              itself like scheduling jobs, executing jobs etc.).

       <B>host</B>   The host from which the action was initiated (e.g. the submit
              host, the qmaster host, etc.).

       <B>state_time</B>
              Reserved field for later use.

       <B>submission_time</B>
              Time when the job was submitted.

       <B>job_name</B>
              The job name (from the <B>-N</B> submission option).

       <B>owner</B>  The job owner.

       <B>group</B>  The Unix group of the job owner.

       <B>project</B>
              The project the job is running in.

       <B>department</B>
              The department the job owner is in.

       <B>account</B>
              The account string specified for the job (from the <B>-A</B> submission
              option).

       <B>priority</B>
              The job priority (from the <B>-p</B> submission option).

       <B>message</B>
              A message describing the reported action.

   <B>acct</B>
       Records of type acct are accounting records. Normally, they are written
       whenever a job, a task of an array job, or a task of a parallel job
       terminates. However, for long running jobs an intermediate acct record
       is created once a day after midnight. This results in multiple
       accounting records for a particular job and allows for fine-grained
       resource usage monitoring over time.

       Accounting records have the structure described in <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/accounting.html">accounting(5)</A></B>, with
       the addition the leading time and type fields (which are not used in
       the accounting file).

   <B>queue</B>
       Records of type queue contain state information for queues (queue
       instances).  A queue record has the following fields:

       <B>qname</B>  The cluster queue name.

       <B>hostname</B>
              The hostname of a specific queue instance.

       <B>report_time</B>
              The time when a state change was triggered.

       <B>state</B>  The new queue state.  The possible states are single-letter
              values, as reported by <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qhost.html">qhost(1)</A></B> with the <B>-q</B> option.

   <B>queue_consumable</B>
       A queue_consumable record contains information about queue consumable
       values in addition to queue state information:

       <B>qname</B>  The cluster queue name.

       <B>hostname</B>
              The hostname of a specific queue instance.

       <B>report_time</B>
              The time when a state change was triggered.

       <B>state</B>  The new queue state.

       <B>consumables</B>
              Description of consumable values. Information about multiple
              consumables is separated by space.  A consumable description has
              the format &lt;name&gt;=&lt;actual_value&gt;=&lt;configured value&gt;.

       Consumables are only logged if <B>log_consumables=true</B> is specified in the
       <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_conf.html">sge_conf(5)</A></B> <B>reporting_params</B>, or the consumable is specified in the
       local or global <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/host_conf.html">host_conf(5)</A></B> <B>report_variables</B>.

   <B>host</B>
       A host record contains information about hosts and host load values.
       It contains the following information:

       <B>hostname</B>
              The name of the host.

       <B>report_time</B>
              The time when the reported information was generated.

       <B>state</B>  The new host state.  Currently, Grid Engine doesn't track a host
              state; the field is reserved for future use. Always contains the
              value X.

       <B>load</B> <B>values</B>
              Description of load values. Information about multiple load
              values is separated by space.  A load value description has the
              format &lt;name&gt;=&lt;actual_value&gt;.

   <B>host_consumable</B>
       A host_consumable record contains information about hosts and host
       consumables.  Host consumables can, for example, be licenses.  It
       contains the following information:

       <B>hostname</B>
              The name of the host.

       <B>report_time</B>
              The time when the reported information was generated.

       <B>state</B>  The new host state.  Currently, Grid Engine doesn't track a host
              state; the field is reserved for future use. Always contains the
              value X.

       <B>consumables</B>
              Description of consumable values. Information about multiple
              consumables is separated by space.  A consumable description has
              the format &lt;name&gt;=&lt;actual_value&gt;=&lt;configured value&gt;.

       Consumables are only logged if <B>log_consumables=true</B> is specified in the
       <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_conf.html">sge_conf(5)</A></B> <B>reporting_params</B>, or the consumable is specified in the
       local or global <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/host_conf.html">host_conf(5)</A></B> <B>report_variables</B>.

   <B>sharelog</B>
       The Grid Engine qmaster can dump information about sharetree
       configuration and use to the reporting file.  The <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_conf.html">sge_conf(5)</A></B>
       <B>reporting_params</B> can specify <B>sharelog</B>, which sets an interval in which
       sharetree information will be dumped.  It is set in the format
       HH:MM:SS. A value of 00:00:00 configures qmaster not to dump sharetree
       information. Intervals of several minutes up to hours are sensible
       values for this parameter.  The record contains the following fields

       <B>current</B> <B>time</B>
