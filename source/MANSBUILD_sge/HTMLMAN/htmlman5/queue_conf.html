       queue_conf - Grid Engine queue configuration file format


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       This manual page describes the format of the template file for the
       cluster queue configuration.  Via the <B>-aq</B> and <B>-mq</B> options of the
       <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qconf.html">qconf(1)</A></B> command, you can add cluster queues and modify the
       configuration of any queue in the cluster. Any of these change
       operations can be rejected as a result of a failed integrity
       verification.

       The queue configuration parameters take as values strings, integer
       decimal numbers,  booleans, or time and memory specifiers (see
       <I>time</I><B>_</B><I>specifier</I> and <I>memory</I><B>_</B><I>specifier</I> in <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_types.html">sge_types(5)</A></B>) as well as comma-
       separated lists.

       Note, Grid Engine allows backslashes (\) be used to escape newline
       characters. The backslash and the newline are replaced with a space
       character before any interpretation.


</PRE>
<H2>FORMAT</H2><PRE>
       The following list of parameters specifies the queue configuration file
       content:

   <B>qname</B>
       The name of the cluster queue in the format for <I>queue</I><B>_</B><I>name</I> in
       <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/sge_types.html">sge_types(1)</A></B>.  As template default "template" is used.

   <B>hostlist</B>
       A list of host identifiers in the format for <I>host</I><B>_</B><I>identifier</I> in
       <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/sge_types.html">sge_types(1)</A></B>.  For each host Grid Engine maintains a queue instance for
       running jobs on that particular host. Large numbers of hosts can easily
       be managed by using host groups rather than single host names.  Both
       white-space and "," can be used as list separators.  (Template default:
       NONE.)

       If more than one host is specified it can be desirable to specify
       divergences for certain hosts with additional parameters.  They are
       expressed using the enhanced queue configuration specifier syntax which
       builds upon the regular parameter specifier syntax for each parameter:

       "["<I>host</I><B>_</B><I>identifier</I>=<I>parameters</I><B>_</B><I>specifier</I><B>_</B><I>syntax</I>"]"
       [,"["<I>host</I><B>_</B><I>identifier</I>=<I>parameters</I><B>_</B><I>specifier</I><B>_</B><I>syntax</I>"]" ]

       Note, even in the enhanced queue configuration specifier syntax, an
       entry without brackets is required to denote the default setting, and
       used for all queue instances where no divergences are specified.
       Tuples with a host group <I>host</I><B>_</B><I>identifier</I> override the default setting.
       Tuples with a host <I>name</I> <I>host</I><B>_</B><I>identifier</I> override both the default and
       the host group setting.

       Note also that with the enhanced queue configuration specifier syntax a
       default setting is always needed for each configuration attribute;
       otherwise the queue configuration gets rejected. Ambiguous queue
       configurations with more than one attribute setting for a particular
       host are rejected.  Configurations containing override values for hosts
       not in the execution host list are accepted as "detached", as indicated
       by the <B>-sds</B> argument of <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qconf.html">qconf(1)</A></B>.  The cluster queue should contain an
       unambiguous specification for each configuration attribute of each
       queue instance specified under a hostname in the queue configuration.
       Ambiguous configurations with more than one attribute setting resulting
       from overlapping host groups are indicated by the <B>-explain</B> <B>c</B> argument
       of <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qstat.html">qstat(1)</A></B> and cause the queue instance with ambiguous configurations
       to enter the <B>c</B>(onfiguration ambiguous) state.

   <B>seq_no</B>
       In conjunction with the hosts load situation at some time, this
       parameter specifies this queue's position in the scheduling order
       within the suitable queues for a job to be dispatched according to the
       <B>queue_sort_method</B> (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sched_conf.html">sched_conf(5)</A></B> ).

       Regardless of the <B>queue_sort_method</B> setting, <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qstat.html">qstat(1)</A></B> reports queue
       information in the order defined by the value of the <B>seq_no</B>. Set this
       parameter to a monotonically increasing sequence. (Type: number;
       template default: 0.)

   <B>load_thresholds</B>
       <B>load_thresholds</B> is a list of load thresholds. When one of the
       thresholds is exceeded no further jobs will be scheduled to the queues
       and <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qmon.html">qmon(1)</A></B> will signal an overload condition for the node. Arbitrary
       load values defined in the "host" and "global" complexes (see
       <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/complex.html">complex(5)</A></B> for details) can be used.

       The syntax is that of a comma-separated list, with each list element
       consisting of the <I>complex</I><B>_</B><I>name</I> (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_types.html">sge_types(5)</A></B>) of a load value, an
       equal sign and the threshold value intended to trigger the overload
       situation (e.g. load_avg=1.75,users_logged_in=5).

       <B>Note:</B> Load values as well as consumable resources may be scaled
       differently for different hosts if specified in the corresponding
       execution host definitions (refer to <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/host_conf.html">host_conf(5)</A></B> for more
       information). Load thresholds are compared against the scaled load and
       consumable values.

   <B>suspend_thresholds</B>
       A list of load thresholds with the same semantics as the
       <B>load_thresholds</B> parameter (see above), except that exceeding one of
       these thresholds initiates suspension of one of multiple jobs in the
       queue.  See the <B>nsuspend</B> parameter below for details on the number of
       jobs which are suspended. There is an important relationship between
       the <B>suspend_threshold</B> and the <B>scheduler_interval</B>. If you have for
       example a suspend threshold on the np_load_avg, and the load exceeds
       the threshold, this does not have immediate effect. Jobs continue
       running until the next scheduling run, where the scheduler detects the
       threshold has been exceeded and sends an order to qmaster to suspend
       the job. The same applies for unsuspending.

   <B>nsuspend</B>
       The number of jobs which are suspended/enabled per time interval if at
       least one of the load thresholds in the <B>suspend_thresholds</B> list is
       exceeded or if no <B>suspend_threshold</B> is violated anymore, respectively.
       <B>Nsuspend</B> jobs are suspended in each time interval until no
       <B>suspend_thresholds</B> are exceeded anymore or all jobs in the queue are
       suspended. Jobs are enabled in the corresponding way if the
       <B>suspend_thresholds</B> are no longer exceeded.  The time interval in which
       the suspensions of the jobs occur is defined in <B>suspend_interval</B> below.

   <B>suspend_interval</B>
       The time interval in which further <B>nsuspend</B> jobs are suspended if one
       of the <B>suspend_thresholds</B> (see above for both) is exceeded by the
       current load on the host on which the queue is located.  The time
       interval is also used when enabling the jobs.  The syntax is that of a
       <I>time</I><B>_</B><I>specifier</I> in <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_types.html">sge_types(5)</A></B>.

   <B>priority</B>
       The <B>priority</B> parameter specifies the <B><A HREF="../htmlman2/nice.html">nice(2)</A></B> value at which jobs in
       this queue will be run. It is of type "number" and the default is zero
       (which means no nice value is set explicitly). Negative values (up to
       -20) correspond to a higher scheduling priority; positive values (up to
       +20) correspond to a lower scheduling priority.

       Note, the value of <B>priority</B> has no effect if Grid Engine adjusts
       priorities dynamically to implement ticket-based entitlement policy
       goals. Dynamic priority adjustment is switched  off by default due to
       <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_conf.html">sge_conf(5)</A></B> <B>reprioritize</B> being set to false.

   <B>min_cpu_interval</B>
       The time between two automatic checkpoints in case of transparently
       checkpointing jobs. The maximum of the time requested by the user via
       <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B> and the time defined by the queue configuration is used as the
       checkpoint interval. Since checkpoint files may be quite large, and
       thus writing them to the file system may become expensive, users and
       administrators are advised to choose sufficiently large time intervals.
       <B>min_cpu_interval</B> is of type "time" and the default is 5 minutes (which
       usually is suitable for test purposes only).  The syntax is that of a
       <I>time</I><B>_</B><I>specifier</I> in <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_types.html">sge_types(5)</A></B>.

   <B>processors</B>
       A set of processors in case of a multiprocessor execution host can be
       defined to which the jobs executing in this queue are bound. The value
       type of this parameter is a range description like that of the <B>-pe</B>
       option of <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B> (e.g. 1-4,8,10) denoting the processor numbers for
       the processor group to be used. Obviously the interpretation of these
       values relies on operating system specifics and is thus performed
       inside <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> running on the queue host. Therefore, the parsing
       of the parameter has to be provided by the execution daemon and the
       parameter is only passed through <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B> as a string.

       Currently, support is only provided for multiprocessor machines running
       Solaris, SGI multiprocessor machines running IRIX 6.2 and Digital UNIX
       multiprocessor machines.  In the case of Solaris the processor set must
       already exist when this processors parameter is configured, so the
       processor set has to be created manually.  In the case of Digital UNIX
       only one job per processor set is allowed to execute at the same time,
       i.e.  <B>slots</B> (see below) should be set to 1 for this queue.

   <B>qtype</B>
       The type of queue. Currently <I>batch,</I> <I>interactive</I> or a combination in a
       comma separated list, or <I>NONE.</I>

       Jobs that need to be scheduled immediately (<I>qsh</I>, <I>qlogin</I>, <I>qrsh</I> and <I>qsub</I>
       with option <I>-now</I> <I>yes</I>) can ONLY be scheduled on <I>interactive</I> queues.

       The formerly supported types parallel and checkpointing are not allowed
       anymore. A queue instance is implicitly of type parallel/checkpointing
       if there is a parallel environment or a checkpointing interface
       specified for this queue instance in <B>pe_list</B>/<B>ckpt_list</B>.  Formerly
       possible settings e.g.

       qtype   PARALLEL

       could be changed to

       qtype   NONE
       pe_list pe_name

       (Type string; default: batch interactive.)

   <B>pe_list</B>
       The list of administrator-defined parallel environment (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_pe.html">sge_pe(5)</A></B>)
       names to be associated with the queue. The default is <I>NONE</I>.

   <B>ckpt_list</B>
       The list of administrator-defined checkpointing interface names (see
       <I>ckpt</I><B>_</B><I>name</I> in <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/sge_types.html">sge_types(1)</A></B>) to be associated with the queue. The default
       is <I>NONE</I>.

   <B>rerun</B>
       Defines a default behavior for jobs which are aborted by system crashes
       or manual "violent" (via <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/kill.html">kill(1)</A></B>) shutdown of the complete Grid Engine
       system (including the <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_shepherd.html">sge_shepherd(8)</A></B> of the jobs and their process
       hierarchy) on the queue host. As soon as <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> is restarted and
       detects that a job has been aborted for such reasons it can be
       restarted if the jobs are restartable. A job may not be restartable,
       for example,if it updates databases (first reads then writes to the
       same record of a database/file), because abortion of the job may have
       left the database in an inconsistent state. If the owner of a job wants
       to overrule the default behavior for the jobs in the queue the <B>-r</B>
       option of <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B> can be used.

       The type of this parameter is boolean, thus either TRUE or FALSE can be
       specified. The default is FALSE, i.e. do not restart jobs
       automatically.

   <B>slots</B>
       The maximum number of concurrently executing jobs allowed in instances
       of the queue.  Type is number, valid values are 0 to 9999999.

   <B>tmpdir</B>
       The <B>tmpdir</B> parameter specifies the absolute path to the base of the
       temporary directory filesystem. When <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> launches a job, it
       creates a uniquely-named directory in this filesystem for the purpose
       of holding scratch files during job execution. At job completion, this
       directory and its contents are removed automatically. The environment
       variables TMPDIR and TMP are set to the path of each job's scratch
       directory.  (Type string; default: /tmp.)

   <B>shell</B>
       If either <I>posix</I><B>_</B><I>compliant</I> or <I>script</I><B>_</B><I>from</I><B>_</B><I>stdin</I> is specified as the
       <B>shell_start_mode</B> parameter in <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_conf.html">sge_conf(5)</A></B> the <B>shell</B> parameter specifies
       the executable path of the command interpreter (e.g.  <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/sh.html">sh(1)</A></B> or <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/csh.html">csh(1)</A></B>)
       to be used to process the job scripts executed in the queue. The
       definition of <B>shell</B> can be overruled by the job owner via the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B>
       <B>-S</B> option.

       The type of the parameter is string. The default is /bin/csh.

   <B>shell_start_mode</B>
       This parameter defines the mechanisms which are used to actually invoke
       the job scripts on the execution hosts. The following values are
       recognized:

       <I>unix</I><B>_</B><I>behavior</I>
              If a user starts a job shell script under UNIX interactively by
              invoking it just with the script name, the operating system's
              executable loader uses the information provided in a comment
              such as `#!/bin/csh' in the first line of the script to detect
              which command interpreter to start to interpret the script. This
              mechanism is used by Grid Engine when starting jobs if
              <I>unix</I><B>_</B><I>behavior</I> is defined as <B>shell_start_mode</B>.

       <I>posix</I><B>_</B><I>compliant</I>
              POSIX does not consider first script line comments such as
              `#!/bin/csh' significant. The POSIX standard for batch queuing
              systems (P1003.2d) therefore requires a compliant queuing system
              to ignore such lines and to use user specified or configured
              default command interpreters instead. Thus, if <B>shell_start_mode</B>
              is set to <I>posix</I><B>_</B><I>compliant</I> Grid Engine will either use the
              command interpreter indicated by the <B>-S</B> option of the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B>
              command or the <B>shell</B> parameter of the queue to be used (see
              above).  The template default is "unix_behavior".

       <I>script</I><B>_</B><I>from</I><B>_</B><I>stdin</I>
              Setting the <B>shell_start_mode</B> parameter either to <I>posix</I><B>_</B><I>compliant</I>
              or <I>unix</I><B>_</B><I>behavior</I> requires you to set the umask in use for
              <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> such that every user has read access to the
              active_jobs directory in the spool directory of the
              corresponding execution daemon. In case you have <B>prolog</B> and
              <B>epilog</B> scripts configured, they also need to be readable by any
              user who may execute jobs.
              If this violates your site's security policies you may want to
              set <B>shell_start_mode</B> to <I>script</I><B>_</B><I>from</I><B>_</B><I>stdin</I>. This will force Grid
              Engine to open the job script, as well as the epilogue and
              prologue scripts, for reading into STDIN as root (if
              <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> was started as root) before changing to the job
              owner's user account.  The script is then fed into the STDIN
              stream of the command interpreter indicated by the <B>-S</B> option of
              the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B> command or the <B>shell</B> parameter of the queue to be
              used (see above).
              Thus setting <B>shell_start_mode</B> to <I>script</I><B>_</B><I>from</I><B>_</B><I>stdin</I> also implies
              <I>posix</I><B>_</B><I>compliant</I> behavior. <B>Note</B>, however, that feeding scripts
              into the STDIN stream of a command interpreter may cause trouble
              if commands like <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/rsh.html">rsh(1)</A></B> are invoked inside a job script as they
              also process the STDIN stream of the command interpreter. These
              problems can usually be resolved by redirecting the STDIN
              channel of those commands to come from /dev/null (e.g. rsh host
              date &lt; /dev/null). <B>Note</B> <B>also</B>, that any command-line options
              associated with the job are passed to the executing shell. The
              shell will only forward them to the job if they are not
              recognized as valid shell options.

       The default for <B>shell_start_mode</B> is <I>posix</I><B>_</B><I>compliant</I>.  Note, though,
       that the <B>shell_start_mode</B> can only be used for batch jobs submitted by
       <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B> and can't be used for interactive jobs submitted by <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qrsh.html">qrsh(1)</A></B>,
       <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsh.html">qsh(1)</A></B>, <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qlogin.html">qlogin(1)</A></B>.

   <B>prolog</B>
       The executable path of a shell script that is started before execution
       of Grid Engine jobs with the same environment setting as that for the
       Grid Engine jobs to be started afterwards. An optional prefix "user@"
       specifies the user under which this procedure is to be started. The
       procedure's standard output and error output stream are written to the
       same file used for the standard output and error output of the job.

       This procedure is intended as a means for the Grid Engine administrator
       to automate the execution of general site-specific tasks, like the
       preparation of temporary file systems in the same context as the job.
       For a parallel job, only a single instance of the prolog is run on the
       master node.  This queue configuration entry overwrites cluster global
       or execution host specific <B>prolog</B> definitions (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_conf.html">sge_conf(5)</A></B>).

       The default for <B>prolog</B> is the special value NONE, which prevents
       execution of a prologue script.  The  special variables for
       constructing a command line are the same as in <B>prolog</B> definitions of
       the cluster configuration (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_conf.html">sge_conf(5)</A></B>).

       Exit codes for the prolog attribute can be interpreted based on the
       following exit values:
              0: Success
              99: Reschedule job
              100: Put job in error state
              Anything else: Put queue in error state

   <B>epilog</B>
       The executable path of a shell script that is started after execution
       of Grid Engine jobs with the same environment setting as that for the
       Grid Engine job that has just completed.  An optional prefix "user@"
       specifies the user under which this procedure is to be started. The
       procedure's standard output and the error output stream are written to
       the same file used for the standard output and error output of the job.

       This procedure is intended as a means for the Grid Engine administrator
       to automate the execution of general site-specific tasks like the
       cleaning up of temporary file systems in the same context as the job.
       For a parallel job, only a single instance of the epilog is run on the
       master node.  This queue configuration entry overwrites cluster global
       or execution host specific <B>epilog</B> definitions (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_conf.html">sge_conf(5)</A></B>).

       The default for <B>epilog</B> is the special value NONE, which prevents
       execution of an epilogue script.  The special variables for composing a
       command line are the same as for <B>prolog</B> definitions of the cluster
       configuration (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_conf.html">sge_conf(5)</A></B>).

       Exit codes for the epilog attribute are interpreted as follows:
              0: Success
              99: Reschedule job
              100: Put job in error state
              Anything else: Put queue in error state

   <B>starter_method</B>
       The specified executable path will be used as a job starter facility
       responsible for starting batch jobs.  The executable path will be
       executed instead of the configured shell to start the job. The job
       arguments will be passed as arguments to the job starter. The following
       environment variables are used to pass information to the job starter
       concerning the shell environment which was configured or requested to
       start the job.


       <I>SGE</I><B>_</B><I>STARTER</I><B>_</B><I>SHELL</I><B>_</B><I>PATH</I>
              The name of the requested shell to start the job

       <I>SGE</I><B>_</B><I>STARTER</I><B>_</B><I>SHELL</I><B>_</B><I>START</I><B>_</B><I>MODE</I>
              The configured <B>shell_start_mode</B>

       <I>SGE</I><B>_</B><I>STARTER</I><B>_</B><I>USE</I><B>_</B><I>LOGIN</I><B>_</B><I>SHELL</I>
              Set to "true" if the shell is supposed to be used as a login
              shell (see <B>login_shells</B> in <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_conf.html">sge_conf(5)</A></B>).

       The starter_method will not be invoked for qsh, qlogin or qrsh acting
       as rlogin.


   <B>suspend_method</B>
   <B>resume_method</B>
   <B>terminate_method</B>
       These parameters can be used for overwriting the default method used by
       Grid Engine for suspension, release of a suspension and for termination
       of a job. Per default, the signals SIGSTOP, SIGCONT and SIGKILL are
       delivered to the job to perform these actions. However, for some
       applications this is not appropriate.

       If no executable path is given, Grid Engine takes the specified
       parameter entries as the signal to be delivered instead of the default
       signal. A signal must be either a positive number or a signal name with
       <B>"SIG"</B> as prefix and the signal name as printed by <I>kill</I> <I>-l</I> (e.g.
       SIGTERM).

       If an executable path is given (it must be an <I>absolute</I> <I>path</I> starting
       with a "/") then this command, together with its arguments, is started
       by Grid Engine to perform the appropriate action. The following special
       variables are expanded at runtime and can be used (besides any other
       strings which have to be interpreted by the procedures) to compose a
       command line:

       <I>$host</I>  The name of the host on which the procedure is started.

       <I>$job</I><B>_</B><I>owner</I>
              The user name of the job owner.

       <I>$job</I><B>_</B><I>id</I>
              Grid Engine's unique job identification number.

       <I>$job</I><B>_</B><I>name</I>
              The name of the job.

       <I>$queue</I> The name of the queue.

       <I>$job</I><B>_</B><I>pid</I>
              The pid of the job.

       Note that a method is only executed on the master node of a parallel
       job, so it may be necessary to propagate the necessary action to slave
       nodes explicitly.  (However, MPI implementations may, for instance,
       respond to SIGTSTP sent to the master process by stopping all the
       distributed processes.)  If an executable is used for a method, it is
       started the same environment setting as that for the job concerned (see
       <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B>).

       The normal Grid Engine-defined environment variables are exported to
       the prolog (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B>); thus, say, it could choose the appropriate
       method according to <B>$PE</B>.

   <B>notify</B>
       The time to wait between delivery of SIGUSR1/SIGUSR2 notification
       signals and suspend/kill signals if the job was submitted with the
       <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B> <I>-notify</I> option.

   <B>owner_list</B>
       The <B>owner_list</B> comprises comma-separated <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/login.html">login(1)</A></B> user names (see
       <I>user</I><B>_</B><I>name</I> in <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/sge_types.html">sge_types(1)</A></B>) of those users who are authorized to disable
       and suspend this queue through <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qmod.html">qmod(1)</A></B>.  (Grid Engine operators and
       managers can do this by default.) It is customary to set this field for
       queues on interactive workstations where the computing resources are
       shared between interactive sessions and Grid Engine jobs, allowing the
       workstation owner to have priority access.  (default: NONE).

   <B>user_lists</B>
       The <B>user_lists</B> parameter contains a comma-separated list of Grid Engine
       user access list names as described in <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/access_list.html">access_list(5)</A></B>.  Each user
       contained in at least one of the given access lists has access to the
       queue. If the <B>user_lists</B> parameter is set to NONE (the default) any
       user has access if not explicitly excluded via the <B>xuser_lists</B>
       parameter described below.  If a user is contained both in an access
       list in <B>xuser_lists</B> and <B>user_lists</B>, the user is denied access to the
       queue.

   <B>xuser_lists</B>
       The <B>xuser_lists</B> parameter contains a comma-separated list of Grid
       Engine user access list names as described in <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/access_list.html">access_list(5)</A></B>.  Each
       user contained in at least one of the given access lists is not allowed
       to access the queue. If the <B>xuser_lists</B> parameter is set to NONE (the
       default) any user has access.  If a user is contained both in an access
       list in <B>xuser_lists</B> and <B>user_lists</B>, the user is denied access to the
       queue.

   <B>projects</B>
       The <B>projects</B> parameter contains a comma-separated list of Grid Engine
       projects (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/project.html">project(5)</A></B>) that have access to the queue. Any project
       not in this list is denied access to the queue. If set to NONE (the
       default), any project has access that is not specifically excluded via
       the <B>xprojects</B> parameter described below. If a project is in both the
       <B>projects</B> and <B>xprojects</B> parameters, the project is denied access to the
       queue.

   <B>xprojects</B>
       The <B>xprojects</B> parameter contains a comma-separated list of Grid Engine
       projects (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/project.html">project(5)</A></B>) that are denied access to the queue. If set
       to NONE (the default), no projects are denied access other than those
       denied access based on the <B>projects</B> parameter described above.  If a
       project is in both the <B>projects</B> and <B>xprojects</B> parameters, the project
       is denied access to the queue.

   <B>subordinate_list</B>
       There are two different types of subordination:

       <B>1.</B> <B>Queuewise</B> <B>subordination</B>

       A list of Grid Engine queue names in the format for <I>queue</I><B>_</B><I>name</I> in
       <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/sge_types.html">sge_types(1)</A></B>.  Subordinate relationships are in effect only between
       queue instances residing at the same host.  The relationship does not
       apply and is ignored when jobs are running in queue instances on other
       hosts.  Queue instances residing on the same host will be suspended
       when a specified count of jobs is running in this queue instance.  The
       list specification is the same as that of the <B>load_thresholds</B> parameter
       above, e.g. low_pri_q=5,small_q. The numbers denote the job slots of
       the queue that have to be filled in the superordinated queue to trigger
       the suspension of the subordinated queue. If no value is assigned, a
       suspension is triggered if all slots of the queue are filled.

       On nodes which host more than one queue, you might wish to accord
       better service to certain classes of jobs (e.g., queues that are
       dedicated to parallel processing might need priority over low priority
       production queues). The default is NONE.

       <B>2.</B> <B>Slotwise</B> <B>preemption</B>

       Slotwise preemption provides a means to ensure that high priority jobs
       get the resources they need, while at the same time low priority jobs
       on the same host are not unnecessarily preempted, maximizing the host
       utilization.  Slotwise preemption is designed to provide different
       preemption actions, but with the current implementation only suspension
       is provided.  This means there is a subordination relationship defined
       between queues similar to the queue-wise subordination, but if the
       suspend threshold is exceeded, the whole subordinated queue is not
       suspended, only single tasks running in single slots.

       As with queue-wise subordination, the subordination relationships are
       in effect only between queue instances residing at the same host. The
       relationship does not apply and is ignored when jobs and tasks are
       running in queue instances on other hosts.

       The syntax is:

       slots=<I>threshold</I>(<I>queue</I><B>_</B><I>list</I>)

       where

       <I>threshold</I> =a positive integer number

       <I>queue</I><B>_</B><I>list</I>=<I>queue</I><B>_</B><I>def</I>[,<I>queue</I><B>_</B><I>list</I>]

       <I>queue</I><B>_</B><I>def</I> =<I>queue</I>[:<I>seq</I><B>_</B><I>no</I>][:<I>action</I>]

       <I>queue</I>     =a Grid Engine queue name in the format for <I>queue</I><B>_</B><I>name</I> in
              <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/sge_types.html">sge_types(1)</A></B>.

       "<I>seq</I><B>_</B><I>no</I>"    =sequence number among all subordinated queues of the same
              depth in the tree.
              The higher the sequence number, the lower is the priority of the
              queue.  Default is 0, which is the highest priority.

       <I>action</I>    =the action to be taken if the threshold is exceeded.
              Supported are:
              "sr": Suspend the task with the shortest run time.
              "lr": Suspend the task with the longest run time.
              Default is "sr".

       Some examples of possible configurations and their functionalities:

       a) The simplest configuration

       subordinate_list   slots=2(B.q)

       which means the queue "B.q" is subordinated to the current queue (let's
       call it "A.q"), the suspend threshold for all tasks running in "A.q"
       and "B.q" on the current host is two, the sequence number of "B.q" is
       "0" and the action is "suspend task with shortest run time first". This
       subordination relationship looks like this:

             A.q
              |
             B.q

       This could be a typical configuration for a host with a dual core CPU.
       This subordination configuration ensures that tasks that are scheduled
       to "A.q" always get a CPU core for themselves, while jobs in "B.q" are
       not preempted as long as there are no jobs running in "A.q".

       If there is no task running in "A.q", two tasks are running in "B.q"
       and a new task is scheduled to "A.q", the sum of tasks running in "A.q"
       and "B.q" is three. Three is greater than two, so this triggers the
       defined action. This causes the task with the shortest run time in the
       subordinated queue "B.q" to be suspended. After suspension, there is
       one task running in "A.q", one task running in "B.q", and one task
       suspended in "B.q".

       b) A simple tree

       subordinate_list   slots=2(B.q:1, C.q:2)

       This defines a small tree that looks like this:

             A.q
            /   \
          B.q   C.q

       A use case for this configuration could be a host with a dual core CPU
       and queue "B.q" and "C.q" for jobs with different requirements, e.g.
       "B.q" for interactive jobs, "C.q" for batch jobs.  Again, the tasks in
       "A.q" always get a CPU core, while tasks in "B.q" and "C.q" are
       suspended only if the threshold of running tasks is exceeded.  Here the
       sequence number among the queues of the same depth comes into play.
       Tasks scheduled to "B.q" can't directly trigger the suspension of tasks
       in "C.q", but if there is a task to be suspended, first "C.q" will be
       searched for a suitable task.

       If there is one task running in "A.q", one in "C.q" and a new task is
       scheduled to "B.q", the threshold of "2" in "A.q", "B.q" and "C.q" is
       exceeded. This triggers the suspension of one task in either "B.q" or
       "C.q". The sequence number gives "B.q" a higher priority than "C.q",
       therefore the task in "C.q" is suspended. After suspension, there is
       one task running in "A.q", one task running in "B.q" and one task
       suspended in "C.q".

       c) More than two levels

       Configuration of A.q: subordinate_list   slots=2(B.q)
       Configuration of B.q: subordinate_list   slots=2(C.q)

       looks like this:

             A.q
              |
             B.q
              |
             C.q

       These are three queues with high, medium and low priority.  If a task
       is scheduled to "C.q", first the subtree consisting of "B.q" and "C.q"
       is checked, the number of tasks running there is counted. If the
       threshold which is defined in "B.q" is exceeded, the job in "C.q" is
       suspended. Then the whole tree is checked, if the number of tasks
       running in "A.q", "B.q" and "C.q" exceeds the threshold defined in
       "A.q" the task in "C.q" is suspended. This means, the effective
       threshold of any subtree is not higher than the threshold of the root
       node of the tree.  If in this example a task is scheduled to "A.q",
       immediately the number of tasks running in "A.q", "B.q" and "C.q" is
       checked against the threshold defined in "A.q".

       d) Any tree

              A.q
             /   \
           B.q   C.q
          /     /   \
        D.q    E.q  F.q
                       \
                        G.q

       The computation of the tasks that are to be (un)suspended always starts
       at the queue instance that is modified, i.e. a task is scheduled to, a
       task ends at, the configuration is modified, a manual or other
       automatic (un)suspend is issued, except when it is a leaf node, like
       "D.q", "E.q" and "G.q" in this example. Then the computation starts at
       its parent queue instance (like "B.q", "C.q" or "F.q" in this example).
       From there first all running tasks in the whole subtree of this queue
       instance are counted. If the sum exceeds the threshold configured in
       the subordinate_list, in this subtree a task is sought to be suspended.
       Then the algorithm proceeds to the parent of this queue instance,
       counts all running tasks in the whole subtree below the parent, and
       checks if the number exceeds the threshold configured in the parent's
       subordinate_list. If so, it searches for a task to suspend in the whole
       subtree below the parent. And so on, until it did this computation for
       the root node of the tree.


   <B>complex_values</B>
       <B>complex_values</B> defines quotas for resource attributes managed via this
       queue. The syntax is the same as for <B>load_thresholds</B> (see above). The
       quotas are related to the resource consumption of all jobs in a queue
       in the case of consumable resources (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/complex.html">complex(5)</A></B> for details on
       consumable resources) or they are interpreted on a per queue slot (see
       <B>slots</B> above) basis in the case of non-consumable resources. Consumable
       resource attributes are commonly used to manage free memory, free disk
       space or available floating software licenses, while non-consumable
       attributes usually define distinctive characteristics, like the type of
       hardware installed.

       For consumable resource attributes an available resource amount is
       determined by subtracting the current resource consumption of all
       running jobs in the queue from the quota in the <B>complex_values</B> list.
       Jobs can only be dispatched to a queue if no resource requests exceed
       any corresponding resource availability obtained by this scheme. The
       quota definition in the <B>complex_values</B> list is automatically replaced
       by the current load value reported for this attribute if load is
       monitored for this resource and if the reported load value is more
       stringent than the quota. This effectively avoids oversubscription of
       resources.

       <B>Note:</B> Load values replacing the quota specifications may have become
       more stringent because they have been scaled (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/host_conf.html">host_conf(5)</A></B>) and/or
       load adjusted (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sched_conf.html">sched_conf(5)</A></B>).  The <I>-F</I> option of <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qstat.html">qstat(1)</A></B> and the
       load display in the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qmon.html">qmon(1)</A></B> queue control dialog (activated by clicking
       on a queue icon while the "Shift" key is pressed) provide detailed
       information on the actual availability of consumable resources and on
       the origin of the values taken into account currently.

       <B>Note</B> <B>also:</B> The resource consumption of running jobs (used for the
       availability calculation) as well as the resource requests of the jobs
       waiting to be dispatched either may be derived from explicit user
       requests during job submission (see the <I>-l</I> option to <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B>) or from a
       "default" value configured for an attribute by the administrator (see
       <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/complex.html">complex(5)</A></B>).  The <I>-r</I> option to <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qstat.html">qstat(1)</A></B> can be used for retrieving full
       detail on the actual resource requests of all jobs in the system.

       For non-consumable resources Grid Engine simply compares the job's
       attribute requests with the corresponding specification in
       <B>complex_values</B>, taking the relation operator of the complex attribute
       definition into account (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/complex.html">complex(5)</A></B>).  If the result of the
       comparison is "true", the queue is suitable for the job with respect to
       the particular attribute. For parallel jobs each queue slot to be
       occupied by a parallel task is meant to provide the same resource
       attribute value.

       <B>Note:</B> Only numeric complex attributes can be defined as consumable
       resources, hence non-numeric attributes are always handled on a per
       queue slot basis.

       The default value for this parameter is NONE, i.e. no administrator
       defined resource attribute quotas are associated with the queue.

   <B>calendar</B>
       specifies the <B>calendar</B> to be valid for this queue or contains NONE (the
       default). A calendar defines the availability of a queue depending on
       time of day, week and year. Please refer to <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/calendar_conf.html">calendar_conf(5)</A></B> for
       details on the Grid Engine calendar facility.

       <B>Note:</B> Jobs can request queues with a certain calendar model via a "-l
       c=<I>cal</I><B>_</B><I>name</I>" option to <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B>.

   <B>initial_state</B>
       defines an initial state for the queue, either when adding the queue to
       the system for the first time or on start-up of the <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> on the
       host on which the queue resides. Possible values are:

       default   The queue is enabled when adding the queue, or is reset to
                 the previous status when <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> comes up (this
                 corresponds to the behavior in earlier Grid Engine releases
                 not supporting initial_state).

       enabled   The queue is enabled in either case. This is equivalent to a
                 manual and explicit '<I>qmod</I> <I>-e</I>' command (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qmod.html">qmod(1)</A></B>).

       disabled  The queue is disable in either case. This is equivalent to a
                 manual and explicit '<I>qmod</I> <I>-d</I>' command (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qmod.html">qmod(1)</A></B>).


</PRE>
<H2>RESOURCE LIMITS</H2><PRE>
       The first two resource limit parameters, <B>s_rt</B> and <B>h_rt</B>, are implemented
       by Grid Engine. They define the "real time" (also called "elapsed" or
       "wall clock" time) passed since the start of the job. If <B>h_rt</B> is
       exceeded by a job running in the queue, it is aborted via the SIGKILL
       signal (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/kill.html">kill(1)</A></B>).  If <B>s_rt</B> is exceeded, the job is first "warned"
       via the SIGUSR1 signal (which can be caught by the job) and finally
       aborted after the notification time defined in the queue configuration
       parameter <B>notify</B> (see above) has passed. In cases when <B>s_rt</B> is used in
       combination with job notification it might be necessary to configure a
       signal other than SIGUSR1 using the NOTIFY_KILL and NOTIFY_SUSP
       execd_params (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_conf.html">sge_conf(5)</A></B>) so that the jobs' signal-catching
       mechanism can differ in each case and react accordingly.

       The resource limit parameters <B>s_cpu</B> and <B>h_cpu</B> are implemented by Grid
       Engine as a job limit. They impose a limit on the amount of combined
       CPU time consumed by all the processes in the job.  If <B>h_cpu</B> is
       exceeded by a job running in the queue, it is aborted via a SIGKILL
       signal (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/kill.html">kill(1)</A></B>).  If <B>s_cpu</B> is exceeded, the job is sent a SIGXCPU
       signal which can be caught by the job.  If you wish to allow a job to
       be "warned" so it can exit gracefully before it is killed, then you
       should set the <B>s_cpu</B> limit to a lower value than <B>h_cpu</B>.  For parallel
       processes, the limit is applied per slot, which means that the limit is
       multiplied by the number of slots being used by the job before being
       applied.

       The resource limit parameters <B>s_vmem</B> and <B>h_vmem</B> are implemented by Grid
       Engine as a job limit.  They impose a limit on the amount of combined
       virtual memory consumed by all the processes in the job. If <B>h_vmem</B> is
       exceeded by a job running in the queue, it is aborted via a SIGKILL
       signal (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/kill.html">kill(1)</A></B>).  If <B>s_vmem</B> is exceeded, the job is sent a SIGXCPU
       signal which can be caught by the job.  If you wish to allow a job to
       be "warned" so it can exit gracefully before it is killed, then you
       should set the <B>s_vmem</B> limit to a lower value than <B>h_vmem</B>.  For parallel
       processes, the limit is applied per slot which means that the limit is
       multiplied by the number of slots being used by the job before being
       applied.

       The remaining parameters in the queue configuration template specify
       per-job soft and hard resource limits as implemented by the
       <B><A HREF="../htmlman2/setrlimit.html">setrlimit(2)</A></B> system call. See this manual page on your system for more
       information.  By default, each limit field is set to infinity (which
       means RLIM_INFINITY as described in the <B><A HREF="../htmlman2/setrlimit.html">setrlimit(2)</A></B> manual page). The
       value type for the CPU-time limits <B>s_cpu</B> and <B>h_cpu</B> is time. The value
       type for the other limits is memory.  <B>Note:</B> Not all systems support
       <B><A HREF="../htmlman2/setrlimit.html">setrlimit(2)</A></B>.

       <B>Note</B> <B>also:</B> s_vmem and h_vmem (virtual memory) are only available on
       systems supporting RLIMIT_VMEM (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman2/setrlimit.html">setrlimit(2)</A></B> on your operating
       system).

       The UNICOS operating system supplied by SGI/Cray does not support the
       <B><A HREF="../htmlman2/setrlimit.html">setrlimit(2)</A></B> system call, using their own resource limit-setting system
       call instead.  For UNICOS systems only, the following meanings apply:

       s_cpu     The per-process CPU time limit in seconds.

       s_core    The per-process maximum core file size in bytes.

       s_data    The per-process maximum memory limit in bytes.

       s_vmem    The same as s_data (if both are set the minimum is used).

       h_cpu     The per-job CPU time limit in seconds.

       h_data    The per-job maximum memory limit in bytes.

       h_vmem    The same as h_data (if both are set the minimum is used).

       h_fsize   The total number of disk blocks that this job can create.
