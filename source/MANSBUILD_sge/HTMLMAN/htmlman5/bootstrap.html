<H2>NAME</H2><PRE>
       bootstrap - Grid Engine bootstrap file


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <I>bootstrap</I> contains parameters that are needed for the startup of Grid
       Engine components.  It is created during the sge_qmaster installation.
       Modifying <I>bootstrap</I> in a running system is not supported.


</PRE>
<H2>FORMAT</H2><PRE>
       The paragraphs that follow provide brief descriptions of the individual
       parameters that comprise the bootstrap configuration for a Grid Engine
       cluster:

   <B>admin_user</B>
       Administrative user account used by Grid Engine for all internal file
       handling (status spooling, message logging, etc.). Can be used in cases
       where the root account does not have the corresponding file access
       permissions (e.g. on a shared file system without global root
       read/write access).

       As a parameter set at installation time, changing <B>admin_user</B> in a
       running system is not supported. Changing it manually on a shut-down
       cluster is possible, but if access to the Grid Engine spooling area is
       interrupted, this will result in unpredictable behavior.

       The <B>admin_user</B> parameter has no default value, but instead it is
       defined during the master installation procedure.

   <B>default_domain</B>
       Only needed if your Grid Engine cluster covers hosts belonging to more
       than a single DNS domain. In this case it can be used if your hostname
       resolving yields both qualified and unqualified hostnames for the hosts
       in one of the DNS domains.  The value of <B>default_domain</B> is appended to
       the unqualified hostname to define a fully qualified hostname.  The
       <B>default_domain</B> parameter will have no effect if <B>ignore_fqdn</B> is set to
       "true".

       As a parameter set at installation time, changing <B>default_domain</B> in a
       running system is not supported. The default for <B>default_domain</B> is
       "none", in which case it will not be used.

   <B>ignore_fqdn</B>
       Ignore fully qualified domain name component of hostnames. Should be
       set if all hosts belonging to a Grid Engine cluster are part of a
       single DNS domain. It is switched on if set to either "true" or "1".
       Switching it on may solve problems with load reports due to different
       hostname resolutions across the cluster.

       As a parameter set at installation time, changing <B>ignore_fqdn</B> in a
       running system is not supported. The default for <B>ignore_fqdn</B> is "true".

   <B>spooling_method</B>
       Defines how <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B> writes its configuration and the status
       information of a running cluster.

       The available spooling methods are <I>berkeleydb</I> and <I>classic</I>.

   <B>spooling_lib</B>
       The name of a shared library containing the <B>spooling_method</B> to be
       loaded at <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B> initialization time.  The extension
       characterizing a shared library (.so, .sl, .dylib etc.) is not
       contained in <B>spooling_lib</B>.

       If <B>spooling_method</B> was set to <I>berkeleydb</I> during installation,
       <B>spooling_lib</B> is set to <I>libspoolb</I>, and if <I>classic</I> was chosen as
       <B>spooling_method</B>, <B>spooling_lib</B> is set to <I>libspoolc</I>.

       Not all operating systems allow the dynamic loading of libraries. On
       these platforms a certain spooling method (default: berkeleydb) is
       compiled into the binaries and the parameter <B>spooling_lib</B> will be
       ignored.

   <B>spooling_params</B>
       Defines parameters of the chosen spooling method that are needed to
       initialize the spooling framework, e.g. to open database files or to
       connect to a certain database server.

       The spooling parameters value for spooling method <I>berkeleydb</I> is
       [rpc_server:]database directory, e.g.
       /sge_local/default/spool/qmaster/spooldb for spooling to a local
       filesystem, or myhost:sge for spooling over a Berkeley DB RPC server.

       For spooling method <I>classic</I> the spooling parameters take the form
       &lt;common_dir&gt;;&lt;qmaster spool dir&gt;, e.g.
       /sge/default/common;/sge/default/spool/qmaster

   <B>binary_path</B>
       The directory path where the Grid Engine binaries reside. It is used
       within Grid Engine components to locate and startup other Grid Engine
       programs.

       The path name given here is searched for binaries as well as any
       directory below with a directory name equal to the current operating
       system architecture. Therefore, /usr/SGE/bin will work for all
       architectures, if the corresponding binaries are located in
       subdirectories named aix43, lx-amd64, lx-x86, hp11, hp11-64, sol-amd64,
       sol-sparc etc.

       The default location for the binary path is &lt;sge_root&gt;/bin

   <B>qmaster_spool_dir</B>
       The location where the master spool directory resides. Only the
       <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B> and <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_shadowd.html">sge_shadowd(8)</A></B> need to have access to this
       directory.  The master spool directory - in particular the job_scripts
       directory and the messages log file - may become quite large, depending
       on the size of the cluster and the number of jobs. Be sure to allocate
       enough disk space and regularly clean off the log files, e.g. via a
       <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/cron.html">cron(8)</A></B> job.

       As a parameter set at installation time, changing <B>qmaster_spool_dir</B> in
       a running system is not supported.

       The default location for the master spool directory is
       &lt;sge_root&gt;/&lt;cell&gt;/spool/qmaster.

   <B>security_mode</B>
       The security mode defines the set of security features the installed
       cluster is using.

       Possible security mode settings are none, afs, dce, kerberos, csp (no
       additional security, AFS, DCE, KERBEROS, CSP security model).

   <B>listener_threads</B>
       The number of listener threads (defaults set by installation).

   <B>worker_threads</B>
       The number of worker threads (defaults set by installation).

   <B>scheduler_threads</B>
       The number of scheduler threads (allowed: 0-1, default set by
       installation: 1, off: 0).  (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qconf.html">qconf(1)</A></B> -kt/-at option)

   <B>jvm_threads</B>
       The number of JVM threads (allowed: 0-1, default set by installation,
       off: 0).
