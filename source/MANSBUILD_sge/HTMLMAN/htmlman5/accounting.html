<H2>NAME</H2><PRE>
       accounting - Grid Engine accounting file format


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       An accounting record is written to the Grid Engine accounting file
       <I>$SGE</I><B>_</B><I>ROOT/$SGE</I><B>_</B><I>CELL/common/reporting</I> for each finished job if
       <B>accounting=true</B> is specified in the <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_conf.html">sge_conf(5)</A></B> <B>reporting_params</B>.  This
       occurs at intervals of the <B>accounting_flush_time</B> specified in the same
       place.  The accounting file is processed by <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qacct.html">qacct(1)</A></B> to derive
       accounting statistics.


</PRE>
<H2>FORMAT</H2><PRE>
       Each job is represented by a line in the accounting file. Empty lines,
       and lines which contain one character or less are ignored by <I>qacct</I>.
       Accounting record entries are separated by colon (':') characters. The
       entries denote in their order of appearance:

   <B>qname</B>
       Name of the cluster queue in which the job has run.

   <B>hostname</B>
       Name of the execution host.

   <B>group</B>
       The effective group id of the job owner when executing the job.

   <B>owner</B>
       Owner of the Grid Engine job.

   <B>job_name</B>
       Job name.

   <B>job_number</B>
       Job identifier (job number).

   <B>account</B>
       An account string as specified by the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B> or <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qalter.html">qalter(1)</A></B> <B>-A</B> option.

   <B>priority</B>
       Priority value assigned to the job, corresponding to the <B>priority</B>
       parameter in the queue configuration (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html">queue_conf(5)</A></B>).

   <B>submission_time</B>
       Submission time.

   <B>start_time</B>
       Start time.

   <B>end_time</B>
       End time.

   <B>failed</B>
       Indicates the problem which occurred in case a job could not be started
       on the execution host (e.g. because the owner of the job did not have a
       valid account on that machine). If Grid Engine tries to start a job
       multiple times, this may lead to multiple entries in the reporting file
       corresponding to the same job ID.

   <B>exit_status</B>
       Exit status of the job script (or Grid Engine-specific status in case
       of certain error conditions).  The exit status is determined by
       following the normal shell conventions.  If the command terminates
       normally the value of the command is its exit status.  However, in the
       case that the command exits abnormally, a value of 0200 (octal), 128
       (decimal) is added to the value of the command to make up the exit
       status.

              For example: If a job dies through signal 9 (SIGKILL) then the
              exit status becomes 128 + 9 = 137.

   <B>ru_wallclock</B>
       Difference between <B>end_time</B> and <B>start_time</B> (see above).

   <B>ru_utime</B>
   <B>ru_stime</B>
   <B>ru_maxrss</B>
   <B>ru_ixrss</B>
   <B>ru_ismrss</B>
   <B>ru_idrss</B>
   <B>ru_isrss</B>
   <B>ru_minflt</B>
   <B>ru_majflt</B>
   <B>ru_nswap</B>
   <B>ru_inblock</B>
   <B>ru_oublock</B>
   <B>ru_msgsnd</B>
   <B>ru_msgrcv</B>
   <B>ru_nsignals</B>
   <B>ru_nvcsw</B>
   <B>ru_nivcsw</B>
       These entries follow the contents of the standard Unix rusage structure
       as described in <B><A HREF="../htmlman2/getrusage.html">getrusage(2)</A></B>.  Depending on the operating system where
       the job was executed, some of the fields may be 0.

   <B>project</B>
       The project which was assigned to the job.

   <B>department</B>
       The department which was assigned to the job.

   <B>granted_pe</B>
       The parallel environment which was selected for the job.

   <B>slots</B>
       The number of slots which were dispatched to the job by the scheduler.

   <B>task_number</B>
       Array job task index number.

   <B>cpu</B>
       The CPU time usage in seconds.

   <B>mem</B>
       The integral memory usage in Gbytes seconds.

   <B>io</B>
       The amount of data transferred in input/output operations (if
       available).

   <B>category</B>
       A string specifying the job category.  This contains a space-separated
       pseudo options list for the sub, with components as follows:

       <B>-U</B> <I>user</I><B>_</B><I>list</I>
              An owner/group ACL list composed from <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/host_conf.html">host_conf(5)</A></B>, <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_pe.html">sge_pe(5)</A></B>,
              And <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html">queue_conf(5)</A></B> <B>user_lists</B>/<B>xuser_lists</B> entries.  Entries from
              <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_conf.html">sge_conf(5)</A></B> are not considered since they can only cause a job
              to be accepted/rejected at submit time.  Omitted if there are no
              such configuration entries.

       <B>-P</B> <I>project</I><B>_</B><I>list</I>
              Like <B>-U</B>, but for <B>project</B>/<B>xproject</B> entries.

       <B>-u</B> <I>owner</I>
              The owner's user name, if it was referenced in any RQS (see
              <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_resource_quota.html">sge_resource_quota(5)</A></B>).  Omitted if there was no such reference.

       <B>-q</B> <I>queue</I><B>_</B><I>list</I>
              The hard queue list (only if one was specified).

              The soft resource list (only if soft resources were specified).

       <B>-pe</B> <I>pe</I><B>_</B><I>name</I> <I>pe</I><B>_</B><I>range</I>
              The parallel environment specified for the job (only for
              parallel jobs).

       <B>-ckpt</B> <I>ckpt</I><B>_</B><I>name</I>
              The job's checkpointing environment (only if one was specified).

       <B>-I</B> <I>y</I>   Present only for interactive jobs.

       <B>-ar</B> <I>ar</I><B>_</B><I>id</I>

              if one was specified).

   <B>iow</B>
       The i/o wait time in seconds.

   <B>pe_taskid</B>
       If this identifier is set, the task was part of a parallel job, and was
       passed to Grid Engine via the <B>qrsh</B> <B>-inherit</B> interface.

   <B>maxvmem</B>
       The maximum vmem size in bytes.

   <B>arid</B>
       Advance reservation identifier. If the job used the resources of an
       advance reservation, then this field contains a positive integer
       identifier; otherwise the value is "<B>0</B>" .
