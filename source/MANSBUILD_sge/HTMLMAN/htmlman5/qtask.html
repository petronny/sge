<H2>NAME</H2><PRE>
       qtask - file format of the qtask file.


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       A <I>qtask</I> file defines which commands are submitted to Grid Engine for
       remote execution by <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qtcsh.html">qtcsh(1)</A></B>.  The <I>qtask</I> file optionally may contain
       <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qrsh.html">qrsh(1)</A></B> command-line parameters. These parameters are passed to the
       <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qrsh.html">qrsh(1)</A></B> command being used by <I>qtcsh</I> to submit the commands.

       Both a cluster global <I>qtask</I> file defining cluster wide defaults, and a
       user specific <I>qtask</I> file eventually overriding and enhancing those
       definitions, are supported. The cluster global file resides at
       &lt;sge_root&gt;/&lt;cell/common/qtask, while the user specific file can be
       found at ~/.qtask. An exclamation mark preceding command definitions in
       the cluster global file can be used by the administrator to deny
       overriding of such commands by users.


</PRE>
<H2>FORMAT</H2><PRE>
       The overall format of the <I>qtask</I> file is that of a tabulated list. Each
       line starting with a '#' character is a comment line. Each non-comment
       line defines a command to be started remotely.

       Definition starts with the command name that must match exactly the
       name as typed in a <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qtcsh.html">qtcsh(1)</A></B> command-line. Pathnames are not allowed in
       <I>qtask</I> files. Hence absolute or relative pathnames in <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qtcsh.html">qtcsh(1)</A></B> command-
       lines always lead to local execution, even if the command itself is the
       same as defined in the <I>qtask</I> file.

       The command name can be followed by an arbitrary number of <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qrsh.html">qrsh(1)</A></B>
       option arguments which are passed on to <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qrsh.html">qrsh(1)</A></B> by <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qtcsh.html">qtcsh(1)</A></B>.

       An exclamation mark prefixing the command in the cluster global <I>qtask</I>
       file prevents overriding by the user supplied <I>qtask</I> file.


</PRE>
<H2>EXAMPLES</H2><PRE>
       The following <I>qtask</I> file

              firefox -l a=sol-sparc64 -v DISPLAY=myhost:0
              grep -l h=filesurfer
              verilog -l veri_lic=1

       designates the applications firefox, grep and verilog for interactive
       remote execution through Grid Engine. Firefox is requested to run only
       on Solaris64 architectures with the DISPLAY environment variable set to
       'myhost:0', grep only runs on the host named 'filesurfer', and verilog
       requests availability of a verilog license in order to get executed
       remotely.
