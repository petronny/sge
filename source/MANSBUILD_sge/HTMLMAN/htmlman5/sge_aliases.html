<H2>NAME</H2><PRE>
       sge_aliases - Grid Engine path aliases file format


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       The Grid Engine path aliasing facility provides administrators and
       users with the means to reflect complicated and inhomogeneous file
       system structures in distributed environments (such as user home
       directories mounted under different paths on different hosts) and to
       ensure that Grid Engine is able to locate the appropriate working
       directories for executing batch jobs.

       There is a system global path aliasing file and a user-local file.
       <I>sge</I><B>_</B><I>aliases</I> defines the format of both:

       <B>o</B>  Blank lines, and lines with a '#' sign in the first column, are
          skipped.

       <B>o</B>  Each line other than a blank line or a line with a leading '#' has
          to contain four strings separated by any number of blanks or tabs.

       <B>o</B>  The first string specifies a source path, the second a submit host,
          the third an execution host, and the fourth the source path
          replacement.

       <B>o</B>  Both the submit and the execution host entries may consist of only a
          '*' sign which matches any host.

       If the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B>
        <I>-cwd</I> flag is specified (and only if - otherwise the user's home
       directory on the execution host is selected to execute the job), the
       path aliasing mechanism is activated, and the files are processed as
       follows:

       <B>o</B>  After <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B> has retrieved the physical current working directory
          path, the cluster global path aliasing file is read, if present. The
          user path aliases file is read afterwards as if it were appended to
          the global file.

       <B>o</B>  Lines not to be skipped are read from the top of the file one by one
          while the translations specified by those lines are stored if
          necessary.

       <B>o</B>  A translation is stored only if the submit host entry matches the
          host <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B> is executed on and if the source path forms the initial
          part of either the current working directory or of the source path
          replacements already stored.

       <B>o</B>  As soon as both files are read the stored, path aliasing information
          is passed along with the submitted job.

       <B>o</B>  On the execution host, the aliasing information will be evaluated.
          The leading part of the current working directory will be replaced
          by the source-path replacement if the execution-host entry of the
          path alias matches the executing host. <B>Note:</B> The current working
          directory string will be changed in this case, and subsequent path
          aliases must match the replaced working directory path to be
          applied.

<H2>EXAMPLES</H2><PRE>
       The following is a simple example of a path aliasing file resolving
       problems with inhomogeneous paths if <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/automount.html">automount(8)</A></B> is used:

       =====================================================
       # Path Aliasing File
       # src-path   sub-host   exec-host   replacement
       /tmp_mnt/    *          *           /
       # replaces any occurrence of /tmp_mnt/ by /
       # if submitting or executing on any host.
       # Thus paths on nfs server and clients are the same
       =====================================================
