<H2>NAME</H2><PRE>
       hostgroup - host group entry file format


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       A host group entry is used to merge host names to groups.  Each  host
       group  entry  file defines one group. Inside a group definition file
       you can also reference groups. These groups are called subgroups. A
       subgroup is referenced by the sign "@" as first character of the name.

       A list of currently-configured host group entries can be displayed via
       the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qconf.html">qconf(1)</A></B> <B>-shgrpl</B> option. The contents of each listed host group
       entry can be shown via the <B>-shgrp</B> switch. The output follows the
       <I>hostgroup</I> format description. New host group entries can be created and
       existing can be modified via the <B>-ahgrp</B>, <B>-mhgrp</B>, <B>-dhgrp</B> and <B>-?attr</B>
       options to <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qconf.html">qconf(1)</A></B>.

       Note, Grid Engine allows backslashes (\) be used to escape newline
       characters. The backslash and the newline are replaced with a space
       character before any interpretation.

<H2>FORMAT</H2><PRE>
       A host group entry contains the following parameters:

   <B>group_name</B>
       The group_name defines the host group name. Host group names have to
       begin with an '@' character as explained for <I>hostgroup</I><B>_</B><I>name</I> in
       <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_types.html">sge_types(5)</A></B>.

   <B>hostlist</B>
       The names of all hosts and host groups (see <I>host</I><B>_</B><I>identifier</I> in
       <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/sge_types.html">sge_types(1)</A></B>) which are members of the group.  Only whitespace is
       allowed as list separators. The default value for this parameter is
       NONE.

       Note, if the first character of the <I>host</I><B>_</B><I>identifier</I> is an "@" sign the
       name is used to reference a <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/hostgroup.html">hostgroup(5)</A></B> which is taken as a subgroup
       of this group.



</PRE>
<H2>EXAMPLE</H2><PRE>
       This is a typical host group entry:


       group_name @bigMachines

       hostlist @solaris64 @solaris32 fangorn balrog

       The entry will define a new host group called <B>@bigMachines</B>. In this
       host group are the host <B>fangorn</B>, <B>balrog</B> and all members of the host
       groups <B>@solaris64</B> and <B>@solaris32</B>.
