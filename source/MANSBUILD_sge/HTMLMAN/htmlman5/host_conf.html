       host_conf - Grid Engine execution host configuration file format


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <I>Host</I><B>_</B><I>conf</I> reflects the format of the template file for the execution
       host configuration.  Via the <B>-ae</B> and <B>-me</B> options of the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qconf.html">qconf(1)</A></B>
       command, you can add execution hosts and modify the configuration of
       any execution host in the cluster. Default execution host entries are
       added automatically as soon as a <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> registers to
       <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B> for the very first time from a certain host. The
       <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qconf.html">qconf(1)</A></B> <B>-sel</B> switch can be used to display a list of execution hosts
       currently configured in your Grid Engine system. Via the <B>-se</B> option you
       can print the execution host configuration of a specified host.

       The special hostname "global" can be used to define cluster global
       characteristics.

       Note Grid Engine allows backslashes (\) be used to escape newline
       characters. The backslash and the newline are replaced with a space
       character before any interpretation.


</PRE>
<H2>FORMAT</H2><PRE>
       The format of a <I>host</I><B>_</B><I>conf</I> file is defined as follows:

   <B>hostname</B>
       The execution host's name in the format for <I>host</I><B>_</B><I>name</I> in <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/sge_types.html">sge_types(1)</A></B>.

   <B>load_scaling</B>
       A comma-separated list of scaling values to be applied to each or part
       of the load values being reported by the <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> on the host and
       defined in the cluster global "host" complex (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/complex.html">complex(5)</A></B>).  The
       load scaling factors are intended to level hardware or operating
       system-specific differences between execution hosts.

       The syntax of a load factor specification is as follows: First the name
       of the load value (as defined in the "host" complex) is given and,
       separated by an equal sign, the load scaling value is provided. No
       blanks are allowed in the load_scaling value string.

       The parameter <B>load_scaling</B> is not meaningful for the definition of the
       "global" host.

   <B>complex_values</B>
       <B>complex_values</B> defines quotas for resource attributes managed via this
       host. Each complex attribute is followed by an "=" sign and the value
       specification compliant with the complex attribute type (see
       <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/complex.html">complex(5)</A></B>).  Quota specifications are separated by commas.

       The quotas are related to the resource consumption of all jobs on a
       host in the case of consumable resources (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/complex.html">complex(5)</A></B> for details on
       consumable resources), or they are interpreted on a per-job slot basis
       in the case of non-consumable resources. Consumable resource attributes
       are commonly used to manage free memory, free disk space or available
       floating software licenses, while non-consumable attributes usually
       define distinctive characteristics like type of hardware installed.

       For consumable resource attributes, an available resource amount is
       determined by subtracting the current resource consumption of all
       running jobs on the host from the quota in the <B>complex_values</B> list.
       Jobs can only be dispatched to a host if no resource requests exceed
       any corresponding resource availability obtained by this scheme. The
       quota definition in the <B>complex_values</B> list is automatically replaced
       by the current load value reported for this attribute, if load is
       monitored for this resource and if the reported load value is more
       stringent than the quota. This effectively avoids oversubscription of
       resources.

       <B>Note:</B> Load values replacing the quota specifications may have become
       more stringent because they have been scaled (see <B>load_scaling</B> above)
       and/or load adjusted (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sched_conf.html">sched_conf(5)</A></B>).  The <I>-F</I> option of <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qstat.html">qstat(1)</A></B>
       and the load display in the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qmon.html">qmon(1)</A></B> queue control dialog (activated by
       clicking on a queue icon while the "Shift" key is pressed) provide
       detailed information on the actual availability of consumable resources
       and on the origin of the values taken into account currently.

       <B>Note</B> <B>also:</B> The resource consumption of running jobs (used for the
       availability calculation) as well as the resource requests of the jobs
       waiting to be dispatched either may be derived from explicit user
       requests during job submission (see the <I>-l</I> option to <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B>) or from a
       "default" value configured for an attribute by the administrator (see
       <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/complex.html">complex(5)</A></B>).  The <I>-r</I> option to <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qstat.html">qstat(1)</A></B> can be used for retrieving full
       detail on the actual resource requests of all jobs in the system.

       For non-consumable resources Grid Engine simply compares the job's
       attribute requests with the corresponding specification in
       <B>complex_values</B> taking the relation operator of the complex attribute
       definition into account (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/complex.html">complex(5)</A></B>).  If the result of the
       comparison is "true", the host is suitable for the job with respect to
       the particular attribute. For parallel jobs each job slot to be
       occupied by a parallel task is meant to provide the same resource
       attribute value.

       <B>Note:</B> Only numeric complex attributes can be defined as consumable
       resources and hence non-numeric attributes are always handled on a per
       job slot basis.

       The default value for this parameter is NONE, i.e. no administrator
       defined resource attribute quotas are associated with the host.

   <B>load_values</B>
       This entry cannot be configured but is only displayed in case of a
       <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qconf.html">qconf(1)</A></B> <B>-se</B> command. All load values are displayed as reported by the
       <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> on the host. The load values are shown in a comma-
       separated list. Each load value starts with its name, followed by an
       equal sign and the reported value.

   <B>processors</B>
       <B>Note:</B> Deprecated, may be removed in future release.
       This entry cannot be configured but is only displayed in case of a
       <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qconf.html">qconf(1)</A></B> <B>-se</B> command. Its value is the number of "processors" which has
       been detected by <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> on the corresponding host.  This may
       include "hardware threads" reported by the operating system.

   <B>usage_scaling</B>
       The format is equivalent to <B>load_scaling</B> (see above), the only valid
       attributes to be scaled however are <B>cpu</B> for CPU time consumption, <B>mem</B>
       for memory consumption aggregated over the lifetime of jobs and <B>io</B> for
       data transferred via any I/O devices. The default NONE means "no
       scaling", i.e. all scaling factors are 1.

   <B>user_lists</B>
       The <B>user_lists</B> parameter contains a comma-separated list of so called
       user access lists as described in <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/access_list.html">access_list(5)</A></B>.  Each user contained
       in at least one of the listed access lists has access to the host. If
       the <B>user_lists</B> parameter is set to NONE (the default), any user has
       access if not explicitly excluded via the <B>xuser_lists</B> parameter
       described below.  If a user is contained both in an access list in
       <B>xuser_lists</B> and <B>user_lists</B> the user is denied access to the host.

   <B>xuser_lists</B>
       The <B>xuser_lists</B> parameter contains a comma-separated list of so called
       user access lists as described in <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/access_list.html">access_list(5)</A></B>.  Each user contained
       in at least one of the access lists is not allowed to access the host.
       If the <B>xuser_lists</B> parameter is set to NONE (the default), any user has
       access.  If a user is contained both in <B>xuser_lists</B> and <B>user_lists</B>, the
       user is denied access to the host.

   <B>projects</B>
       The <B>projects</B> parameter contains a comma-separated list of projects that
       have access to the host. Any projects not in this list are denied
       access to the host. If set to NONE (the default), any project has
       access if not specifically excluded via the <B>xprojects</B> parameter
       described below. If a project is in both <B>projects</B> and <B>xprojects</B>, the
       project is denied access to the host.

   <B>xprojects</B>
       The <B>xprojects</B> parameter contains a comma-separated list of projects
       that are denied access to the host. If set to NONE (the default), no
       projects are denied access other than those denied access based on the
       <B>projects</B> parameter described above.  If a project is in both <B>projects</B>
       and <B>xprojects</B>, the project is denied access to the host.

   <B>report_variables</B>
       The <B>report_variables</B> parameter contains a comma-separated list of
       variables that should be written to the reporting file.  The variables
       listed here will be written to the reporting file when a load report
       arrives from an execution host.

       Default settings can be done in the global host. Host-specific settings
       for report_variables will override settings from the global host.
