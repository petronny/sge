       sge_conf - Grid Engine configuration files


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <I>sge</I><B>_</B><I>conf</I> defines the global and local Grid Engine configurations and
       can be shown/modified by <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qconf.html">qconf(1)</A></B> using the -sconf/-mconf options. Only
       root or the cluster administrator may modify <I>sge</I><B>_</B><I>conf.</I>

       At its initial start-up, <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B> checks to see if a valid Grid
       Engine configuration is available at a well known location in the Grid
       Engine internal directory hierarchy.  If so, it loads that
       configuration information and proceeds.  If not, <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B> writes
       a generic configuration containing default values to that same
       location.  The Grid Engine execution daemons <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> upon start-up
       retrieve their configuration from <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B>.

       The actual configuration for both <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B> and <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> is a
       superposition of a <I>global</I> configuration and a <I>local</I> configuration
       pertinent for the host on which a master or execution daemon resides.
       If a local configuration is available, its entries overwrite the
       corresponding entries of the global configuration. <B>Note:</B> The local
       configuration does not have to contain all valid configuration entries,
       but only those which need to be modified against the global entries.

       Note: Grid Engine allows backslashes (\) be used to escape newline
       characters. The backslash and the newline are replaced with a space ("
       ") character before any interpretation.


</PRE>
<H2>FORMAT</H2><PRE>
       The paragraphs that follow provide brief descriptions of the individual
       parameters that compose the global and local configurations for a Grid
       Engine cluster:

   <B>execd_spool_dir</B>
       The execution daemon spool directory path. Again, a feasible spool
       directory requires read/write access permission for root. The entry in
       the global configuration for this parameter can be overwritten by
       execution host local configurations, i.e. each <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> may have a
       private spool directory with a different path, in which case it needs
       to provide read/write permission for the root account of the
       corresponding execution host only.

       Under <B>execd_spool_dir</B> a directory named corresponding to the
       unqualified hostname of the execution host is opened and contains all
       information spooled to disk. Thus, it is possible for the
       <B>execd_spool_dir</B>s of all execution hosts to physically reference the
       same directory path (the root access restrictions mentioned above need
       to be met, however).

       Changing the global <B>execd_spool_dir</B> parameter set at installation time
       is not supported in a running system. If the change should still be
       done it is required to restart all affected execution daemons.  Please
       make sure running jobs have finished before doing so, otherwise running
       jobs will be lost.


       The default location for the execution daemon spool directory is
       $SGE_ROOT/$SGE_CELL/spool.

       The global configuration entry for this value may be overwritten by the
       execution host local configuration.

   <B>mailer</B>
       <B>mailer</B> is the absolute pathname to the electronic mail delivery agent
       on your system. It must accept the following syntax:

              mailer -s &lt;subject-of-mail-message&gt; &lt;recipient&gt;

       Each <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> may use a private mail agent. Changing <B>mailer</B> will
       take immediate effect.

       The default for <B>mailer</B> depends on the operating system of the host on
       which the Grid Engine master installation was run. Common values are
       /bin/mail or /usr/bin/Mail.  Note that since the mail is sent by
       compute hosts, not the master, it may be necessary to take steps to
       route it appropriately, e.g. by using a cluster head node as a "smart
       host" for the private network.

       The global configuration entry for this value may be overwritten by the
       execution host local configuration.

   <B>xterm</B>
       <B>xterm</B> is the absolute pathname to the X Window System terminal
       emulator, <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/xterm.html">xterm(1)</A></B>.

       Changing <B>xterm</B> will take immediate effect.

       The default for <B>xterm</B> is system-dependent.

       The global configuration entry for this value may be overwritten by the
       execution host local configuration.

   <B>load_sensor</B>
       A comma-separated list of executable shell script paths or programs to
       be started by <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> and to be used in order to retrieve site-
       configurable load information (e.g. free space on a certain disk
       partition).

       Each <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> may use a set of private <B>load_sensor</B> programs or
       scripts. Changing <B>load_sensor</B> will take effect after two load report
       intervals (see <B>load_report_time</B>). A load sensor will be restarted
       automatically if the file modification time of the load sensor
       executable changes.

       The global configuration entry for this value may be overwritten by the
       execution host local configuration.

       In addition to the load sensors configured via <B>load_sensor</B>, <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_exec.html">sge_exec(8)</A></B>
       searches for an executable file named <I>qloadsensor</I> in the execution
       host's Grid Engine binary directory path.  If such a file is found, it
       is treated like the configurable load sensors defined in <B>load_sensor</B>.
       This facility is intended for pre-installing a default load sensor.

   <B>prolog</B>
       The executable path of a shell script that is started before execution
       of Grid Engine jobs with the same environment setting as that for the
       Grid Engine jobs to be started afterwards (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B>).  An optional
       prefix "user@" specifies the user under which this procedure is to be
       started. The procedure's standard output and the error output stream
       are written to the same file as used for the standard output and error
       output of each job.

       This procedure is intended as a means for the Grid Engine administrator
       to automate the execution of general site-specific tasks, like the
       preparation of temporary file systems, with a need for the same context
       information as the job.  For a parallel job, only a single instance of
       the prolog is run, on the master node.  Each <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> may use a
       private prolog script.  Correspondingly, the execution host local
       configurations can be overwritten by the queue configuration (see
       <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html">queue_conf(5)</A></B>).  Changing <B>prolog</B> will take immediate effect.

       The default for <B>prolog</B> is the special value NONE, which prevents
       execution of a prolog script.

       The following special variables, expanded at runtime, can be used
       (besides any other strings which have to be interpreted by the
       procedure) to constitute a command line:

       <I>$host</I>  The name of the host on which the prolog or epilog procedures
              are started.

       <I>$job</I><B>_</B><I>owner</I>
              The user name of the job owner.

       <I>$job</I><B>_</B><I>id</I>
              Grid Engine's unique job identification number.

       <I>$job</I><B>_</B><I>name</I>
              The name of the job.

       <I>$processors</I>
              The <B>processors</B> string as contained in the queue configuration
              (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html">queue_conf(5)</A></B>) of the master queue (the queue in which the
              prolog and epilog procedures are started).

       <I>$queue</I> The cluster queue name of the master queue instance, i.e. the
              cluster queue in which the prolog and epilog procedures are
              started.

       <I>$stdin</I><B>_</B><I>path</I>
              The pathname of the stdin file. This is always /dev/null for
              prolog, pe_start, pe_stop and epilog. It is the pathname of the
              stdin file for the job in the job script. When delegated file
              staging is enabled, this path is set to $fs_stdin_tmp_path. When
              delegated file staging is not enabled, it is the stdin pathname
              given via DRMAA or qsub.

       <I>$stdout</I><B>_</B><I>path</I>

       <I>$stderr</I><B>_</B><I>path</I>
              The pathname of the stdout/stderr file. This always points to
              the output/error file. When delegated file staging is enabled,
              this path is set to $fs_stdout_tmp_path/$fs_stderr_tmp_path.
              When delegated file staging is not enabled, it is the
              stdout/stderr pathname given via DRMAA or qsub.

       <I>$merge</I><B>_</B><I>stderr</I>
              If this flag is 1, stdout and stderr are merged in one file, the
              stdout file.  Otherwise (the default), no merging is done.
              Merging of stderr and stdout can be requested via the DRMAA job
              template attribute 'drmaa_join_files' (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman3/drmaa_attributes.html">drmaa_attributes(3)</A></B>)
              or the qsub parameter '-j y' (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B>).

       <I>$fs</I><B>_</B><I>stdin</I><B>_</B><I>host</I>
              When delegated file staging is requested for the stdin file,
              this is the name of the host where the stdin file has to be
              copied from before the job is started.

       <I>$fs</I><B>_</B><I>stdout</I><B>_</B><I>host</I>

       <I>$fs</I><B>_</B><I>stderr</I><B>_</B><I>host</I>
              When delegated file staging is requested for the stdout/stderr
              file, this is the name of the host where the stdout/stderr file
              has to be copied to after the job has run.

       <I>$fs</I><B>_</B><I>stdin</I><B>_</B><I>path</I>
              When delegated file staging is requested for the stdin file,
              this is the pathname of the stdin file on the host
              $fs_stdin_host.

       <I>$fs</I><B>_</B><I>stdout</I><B>_</B><I>path</I>

       <I>$fs</I><B>_</B><I>stderr</I><B>_</B><I>path</I>
              When delegated file staging is requested for the stdout/stderr
              file, this is the pathname of the stdout/stderr file on the host
              $fs_stdout_host/$fs_stderr_host.

       <I>$fs</I><B>_</B><I>stdin</I><B>_</B><I>tmp</I><B>_</B><I>path</I>
              When delegated file staging is requested for the stdin file,
              this is the destination pathname of the stdin file on the
              execution host. The prolog script must copy the stdin file from
              $fs_stdin_host:$fs_stdin_path to localhost:$fs_stdin_tmp_path to
              establish delegated file staging of the stdin file.

       <I>$fs</I><B>_</B><I>stdout</I><B>_</B><I>tmp</I><B>_</B><I>path</I>

       <I>$fs</I><B>_</B><I>stderr</I><B>_</B><I>tmp</I><B>_</B><I>path</I>
              When delegated file staging is requested for the stdout/stderr
              file, this is the source pathname of the stdout/stderr file on
              the execution host. The epilog script must copy the stdout file
              from localhost:$fs_stdout_tmp_path to
              $fs_stdout_host:$fs_stdout_path (the stderr file from
              localhost:$fs_stderr_tmp_path to
              $fs_stderr_host:$fs_stderr_path) to establish delegated file
              staging of the stdout/stderr file.

       <I>$fs</I><B>_</B><I>stdin</I><B>_</B><I>file</I><B>_</B><I>staging</I>

       <I>$fs</I><B>_</B><I>stdout</I><B>_</B><I>file</I><B>_</B><I>staging</I>

       <I>$fs</I><B>_</B><I>stderr</I><B>_</B><I>file</I><B>_</B><I>staging</I>
              When delegated file staging is requested for the
              stdin/stdout/stderr file, the flag is set to "1", otherwise it
              is set to "0" (see in <B>delegated_file_staging</B> how to enable
              delegated file staging).

              These three flags correspond to the DRMAA job template attribute
              'drmaa_transfer_files' (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman3/drmaa_attributes.html">drmaa_attributes(3)</A></B>).

       The global configuration entry for this value may be overwritten by the
       execution host local configuration.

       Exit codes for the prolog attribute can be interpreted based on the
       following exit values:
              0: Success
              99: Reschedule job
              100: Put job in error state
              Anything else: Put queue in error state

   <B>epilog</B>
       The executable path of a shell script that is started after execution
       of Grid Engine jobs with the same environment setting as that for the
       Grid Engine job that has just completed (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B>).  An optional
       prefix "user@" specifies the user under which this procedure is to be
       started. The procedure's standard output and the error output stream
       are written to the same file used also for the standard output and
       error output of each job.

       This procedure is intended as a means for the Grid Engine administrator
       to automate the execution of general site-specific tasks, like the
       cleaning up of temporary file systems with the need for the same
       context information as the job.  For a parallel job, only a single
       instance of the epilog is run on the master node.  Each <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B>
       may use a private epilog script.  Correspondingly, the execution host
       local configurations is can be overwritten by the queue configuration
       (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html">queue_conf(5)</A></B>).  Changing <B>epilog</B> will take immediate effect.

       The default for <B>epilog</B> is the special value NONE, which prevents from
       execution of a epilog script.  The same special variables as for <B>prolog</B>
       can be used to constitute a command line.

       The global configuration entry for this value may be overwritten by the
       execution host local configuration.

       Exit codes for the epilog attribute can be interpreted based on the
       following exit values:
              0: Success
              99: Reschedule job
              100: Put job in error state
              Anything else: Put queue in error state

   <B>shell_start_mode</B>
       <B>Note:</B> Deprecated, may be removed in future release.
       This parameter defines the mechanisms which are used to actually invoke
       the job scripts on the execution hosts. The following values are
       recognized:

       <I>unix</I><B>_</B><I>behavior</I>
              If a user starts a job shell script under UNIX interactively by
              invoking it just with the script name the operating system's
              executable loader uses the information provided in a comment
              such as `#!/bin/csh' in the first line of the script to detect
              which command interpreter to start to interpret the script. This
              mechanism is used by Grid Engine when starting jobs if
              <I>unix</I><B>_</B><I>behavior</I> is defined as <B>shell_start_mode</B>.

       <I>posix</I><B>_</B><I>compliant</I>
              POSIX does not consider first script line comments such a
              `#!/bin/csh' as significant. The POSIX standard for batch
              queueing systems (P1003.2d) therefore requires a compliant
              queueing system to ignore such lines, but to use user-specified
              or configured default command interpreters instead. Thus, if
              <B>shell_start_mode</B> is set to <I>posix</I><B>_</B><I>compliant</I> Grid Engine will
              either use the command interpreter indicated by the <B>-S</B> option of
              the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B> command or the <B>shell</B> parameter of the queue to be
              used (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html">queue_conf(5)</A></B> for details).

       <I>script</I><B>_</B><I>from</I><B>_</B><I>stdin</I>
              Setting the <B>shell_start_mode</B> parameter either to <I>posix</I><B>_</B><I>compliant</I>
              or <I>unix</I><B>_</B><I>behavior</I> requires you to set the umask in use for
              <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> such that every user has read access to the
              active_jobs directory in the spool directory of the
              corresponding execution daemon. In case you have <B>prolog</B> and
              <B>epilog</B> scripts configured, they also need to be readable by any
              user who may execute jobs.
              If this violates your site's security policies you may want to
              set <B>shell_start_mode</B> to <I>script</I><B>_</B><I>from</I><B>_</B><I>stdin</I>. This will force Grid
              Engine to open the job script as well as the epilog and prolog
              scripts for reading into STDIN as root (if <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> was
              started as root) before changing to the job owner's user
              account.  The script is then fed into the STDIN stream of the
              command interpreter indicated by the <B>-S</B> option of the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B>
              command or the <B>shell</B> parameter of the queue to be used (see
              <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html">queue_conf(5)</A></B> for details).
              Thus setting <B>shell_start_mode</B> to <I>script</I><B>_</B><I>from</I><B>_</B><I>stdin</I> also implies
              <I>posix</I><B>_</B><I>compliant</I> behavior. <B>Note</B>, however, that feeding scripts
              into the STDIN stream of a command interpreter may cause trouble
              if commands like <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/rsh.html">rsh(1)</A></B> are invoked inside a job script as they
              also process the STDIN stream of the command interpreter. These
              problems can usually be resolved by redirecting the STDIN
              channel of those commands to come from /dev/null (e.g. rsh host
              date &lt; /dev/null). <B>Note</B> <B>also</B>, that any command-line options
              associated with the job are passed to the executing shell. The
              shell will only forward them to the job if they are not
              recognized as valid shell options.

       Changes to <B>shell_start_mode</B> will take immediate effect.  The default
       for <B>shell_start_mode</B> is <I>posix</I><B>_</B><I>compliant</I>.

       This value is a global configuration parameter only. It cannot be
       overwritten by the execution host local configuration.

   <B>login_shells</B>
       UNIX command interpreters like the Bourne-Shell (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/sh.html">sh(1)</A></B>) or the C-
       Shell (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/csh.html">csh(1)</A></B>) can be used by Grid Engine to start job scripts. The
       command interpreters can either be started as login-shells (i.e. all
       system and user default resource files like .login or .profile will be
       executed when the command interpreter is started, and the environment
       for the job will be set up as if the user has just logged in) or just
       for command execution (i.e. only shell-specific resource files like
       .cshrc will be executed and a minimal default environment is set up by
       Grid Engine - see <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B>).  The parameter <B>login_shells</B> contains a
       comma-separated list of the executable names of the command
       interpreters to be started as login shells.  Shells in this list are
       only started as login shells if the parameter <B>shell_start_mode</B> (see
       above) is set to <I>posix</I><B>_</B><I>compliant</I>.

       Changes to <B>login_shells</B> will take immediate effect.  The default for
       <B>login_shells</B> is sh,bash,csh,tcsh,ksh.

       This value is a global configuration parameter only. It cannot be
       overwritten by the execution host local configuration.

   <B>min_uid</B>
       <B>min_uid</B> places a lower bound on user IDs that may use the cluster.
       Users whose user ID (as returned by <B><A HREF="../htmlman3/getpwnam.html">getpwnam(3)</A></B>) is less than <B>min_uid</B>
       will not be allowed to run jobs on the cluster.

       Changes to <B>min_uid</B> will take immediate effect.  The default for <B>min_uid</B>
       is 0.

       This value is a global configuration parameter only. It cannot be
       overwritten by the execution host local configuration.

   <B>min_gid</B>
       This parameter sets the lower bound on group IDs that may use the
       cluster.  Users whose default group ID (as returned by <B><A HREF="../htmlman3/getpwnam.html">getpwnam(3)</A></B>) is
       less than <B>min_gid</B> will not be allowed to run jobs on the cluster.

       Changes to <B>min_gid</B> will take immediate effect.  The default for <B>min_gid</B>
       is 0.

       This value is a global configuration parameter only. It cannot be
       overwritten by the execution host local configuration.

   <B>user_lists</B>
       The <B>user_lists</B> parameter contains a comma-separated list of user access
       lists as described in <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/access_list.html">access_list(5)</A></B>.  Each user contained in at least
       one of the access lists has access to the cluster. If the <B>user_lists</B>
       parameter is set to NONE (the default) any user has access if not
       explicitly excluded via the <B>xuser_lists</B> parameter described below.  If
       a user is contained both in an access list <B>xuser_lists</B> and <B>user_lists</B>,
       the user is denied access to the cluster.

       Changes to <B>user_lists</B> will take immediate effect.

       This value is a global configuration parameter insofar as it restricts
       access to the whole cluster, but the execution host local configuration
       may define a value to restrict access to that host further.

   <B>xuser_lists</B>
       The <B>xuser_lists</B> parameter contains a comma-separated list of user
       access lists as described in <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/access_list.html">access_list(5)</A></B>.  Each user contained in at
       least one of the access lists is denied access to the cluster. If the
       <B>xuser_lists</B> parameter is set to NONE (the default) any user has access.
       If a user is contained both in an access list in <B>xuser_lists</B> and
       <B>user_lists</B> (see above) the user is denied access to the cluster.

       Changes to <B>xuser_lists</B> will take immediate effect.

       This value is a global configuration parameter insofar as it restricts
       access to the whole cluster, but the execution host local configuration
       may define a value to restrict access to that host further.

   <B>administrator_mail</B>
       <B>administrator_mail</B> specifies a comma-separated list of the electronic
       mail address(es) of the cluster administrator(s) to whom internally-
       generated problem reports are sent. The mail address format depends on
       your electronic mail system and how it is configured; consult your
       system's configuration guide for more information.

       Changing <B>administrator_mail</B> takes immediate effect.  The default for
       <B>administrator_mail</B> is an empty mail list.

       This value is a global configuration parameter only. It cannot be
       overwritten by the execution host local configuration.

   <B>projects</B>
       The <B>projects</B> list contains all projects which are granted access to
       Grid Engine. Users belonging to none of these projects cannot use Grid
       Engine. If users belong to projects in the <B>projects</B> list and the
       <B>xprojects</B> list (see below), they also cannot use the system.

       Changing <B>projects</B> takes immediate effect.  The default for <B>projects</B> is
       none.

       This value is a global configuration parameter only. It cannot be
       overwritten by the execution host local configuration.

   <B>xprojects</B>
       The <B>xprojects</B> list contains all projects that are denied access to Grid
       Engine. Users belonging to one of these projects cannot use Grid
       Engine. If users belong to projects in the <B>projects</B> list (see above)
       and the <B>xprojects</B> list, they also cannot use the system.

       Changing <B>xprojects</B> takes immediate effect.  The default for <B>xprojects</B>
       is none.

       This value is a global configuration parameter only. It cannot be
       overwritten by the execution host local configuration.

   <B>load_report_time</B>
       System load is reported periodically by the execution daemons to
       <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B>.  The parameter <B>load_report_time</B> defines the time
       interval between load reports.

       Each <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> may use a different load report time. Changing
       <B>load_report_time</B> will take immediate effect.

       <B>Note:</B> Be careful when modifying <B>load_report_time</B>. Reporting load too
       frequently might block <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B> especially if the number of
       execution hosts is large. Moreover, since the system load typically
       increases and decreases smoothly, frequent load reports hardly offer
       any benefit.

       The default for <B>load_report_time</B> is 40 seconds.

       The global configuration entry for this value may be overwritten by the
       execution host local configuration.

   <B>reschedule_unknown</B>
       Determines whether jobs on hosts in an unknown state are rescheduled,
       and thus sent to other hosts. Hosts are registered as unknown if
       <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_master.html">sge_master(8)</A></B> cannot establish contact to the <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> on those
       hosts (see <B>max_unheard</B>).  Likely reasons are a breakdown of the host or
       a breakdown of the network connection in between, but also <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B>
       may not be executing on such hosts.

       In any case, Grid Engine can reschedule jobs running on such hosts to
       another system.  <B>reschedule_unknown</B> controls the time which Grid Engine
       will wait before jobs are rescheduled after a host became unknown. The
       time format specification is hh:mm:ss. If the special value 00:00:00 is
       set, then jobs will not be rescheduled from this host.

       Rescheduling is only initiated for jobs which have activated the rerun
       flag (see the <B>-r</B> <B>y</B> option of <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B> and the <B>rerun</B> option of
       <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html">queue_conf(5)</A></B>).  Parallel jobs are only rescheduled if the host on
       which their master task executes is in unknown state. The behavior of
       <B>reschedule_unknown</B> for parallel jobs and for jobs without the rerun
       flag set can be adjusted using the <B>qmaster_params</B> settings
       <B>ENABLE_RESCHEDULE_KILL</B> and <B>ENABLE_RESCHEDULE_SLAVE.</B>

       Checkpointing jobs will only be rescheduled when the <B>when</B> option of the
       corresponding checkpointing environment contains an appropriate flag.
       (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/checkpoint.html">checkpoint(5)</A></B>).  Interactive jobs (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsh.html">qsh(1)</A></B>, <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qrsh.html">qrsh(1)</A></B>, <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qtcsh.html">qtcsh(1)</A></B>)
       are not rescheduled.

       The default for <B>reschedule_unknown</B> is 00:00:00

       The global configuration entry for this value may be over written by
       the execution host local configuration.

   <B>max_unheard</B>
       If <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B> could not contact or was not contacted by the
       execution daemon of a host for <B>max_unheard</B> seconds, all queues residing
       on that particular host are set to status unknown.  <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B>, at
       least, should be contacted by the execution daemons in order to get the
       load reports. Thus, <B>max_unheard</B> should by greater than the
       <B>load_report_time</B> (see above).

       Changing <B>max_unheard</B> takes immediate effect.  The default for
       <B>max_unheard</B> is 5 minutes.

       This value is a global configuration parameter only. It cannot be
       overwritten by the execution host local configuration.

   <B>loglevel</B>
       This parameter specifies the level of detail that Grid Engine
       components such as <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B> or <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> use to produce
       informative, warning or error messages which are logged to the <I>messages</I>
       files in the master and execution daemon spool directories (see the
       description of the <B>execd_spool_dir</B> parameter above). The following
       message levels are available:

       <I>log</I><B>_</B><I>err</I>
              All error events recognized are logged.

       <I>log</I><B>_</B><I>warning</I>
              All error events recognized, and all detected signs of
              potentially erroneous behavior, are logged.

       <I>log</I><B>_</B><I>info</I>
              All error events being recognized, all detected signs of
              potentially erroneous behavior, and a variety of informative
              messages are logged.

       Changing <B>loglevel</B> will take immediate effect.

       The default for <B>loglevel</B> is <I>log</I><B>_</B><I>warning</I>.

       This value is a global configuration parameter only. It cannot be
       overwritten by the execution host local configuration.

   <B>max_aj_instances</B>
       This parameter defines the maximum number of array tasks to be
       scheduled to run simultaneously per array job.  An instance of an array
       task will be created within the master daemon when it gets a start
       order from the scheduler. The instance will be destroyed when the array
       task finishes.  Thus the parameter provides control mainly over the
       memory consumption of array jobs in the master daemon. It is most
       useful for very large clusters and very large array jobs.  The default
       for this parameter is 2000. The value 0 will deactivate this limit and
       will allow the scheduler to start as many array job tasks as suitable
       resources are available in the cluster.

       Changing <B>max_aj_instances</B> will take immediate effect.

       This value is a global configuration parameter only. It cannot be
       overwritten by the execution host local configuration.

   <B>max_aj_tasks</B>
       This parameter defines the maximum number of array job tasks within an
       array job.  <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B> will reject all array job submissions which
       request more than <B>max_aj_tasks</B> array job tasks. The default for this
       parameter is 75000. The value 0 will deactivate this limit.

       Changing <B>max_aj_tasks</B> will take immediate effect.

       This value is a global configuration parameter only. It cannot be
       overwritten by the execution host local configuration.

   <B>max_u_jobs</B>
       The number of active (not finished) jobs which each Grid Engine user
       can have in the system simultaneously is controlled by this parameter.
       A value greater than 0 defines the limit. The default value 0 means
       "unlimited". If the <B>max_u_jobs</B> limit is exceeded by a job submission
       then the submission command exits with exit status 25 and an
       appropriate error message.

       Changing <B>max_u_jobs</B> will take immediate effect.

       This value is a global configuration parameter only. It cannot be
       overwritten by the execution host local configuration.

   <B>max_jobs</B>
       The number of active (not finished) jobs simultaneously allowed in Grid
       Engine is controlled by this parameter. A value greater than 0 defines
       the limit.  The default value 0 means "unlimited". If the <B>max_jobs</B>
       limit is exceeded by a job submission then the submission command exits
       with exit status 25 and an appropriate error message.

       Changing <B>max_jobs</B> will take immediate effect.

       This value is a global configuration parameter only. It cannot be
       overwritten by the execution host local configuration.

   <B>max_advance_reservations</B>
       The number of active (not finished) Advance Reservations simultaneously
       allowed in Grid Engine is controlled by this parameter. A value greater
       than 0 defines the limit. The default value 0 means "unlimited". If the
       <B>max_advance_reservations</B> limit is exceeded by an Advance Reservation
       request then the submission command exits with exit status 25 and an
       appropriate error message.

       Changing <B>max_advance_reservations</B> will take immediate effect.

       This value is a global configuration parameter only. It cannot be
       overwritten by the execution host local configuration.

   <B>enforce_project</B>
       If set to <I>true</I>, users are required to request a project whenever
       submitting a job. See the <B>-P</B> option to <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B> for details.

       Changing <B>enforce_project</B> will take immediate effect.  The default for
       <B>enforce_project</B> is <I>false</I>.

       This value is a global configuration parameter only. It cannot be
       overwritten by the execution host local configuration.

   <B>enforce_user</B>
       If set to <I>true</I>, a <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/user.html">user(5)</A></B> must exist to allow for job submission. Jobs
       are rejected if no corresponding user exists.

       If set to <I>auto</I>, a <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/user.html">user(5)</A></B> object for the submitting user will
       automatically be created during job submission, if one does not already
       exist. The <B>auto_user_oticket</B>, <B>auto_user_fshare</B>,
       <B>auto_user_default_project</B>, and <B>auto_user_delete_time</B> configuration
       parameters will be used as default attributes of the new <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/user.html">user(5)</A></B>
       object.

       Changing <B>enforce_user</B> will take immediate effect.  The default for
       <B>enforce_user</B> is <I>auto</I>.

       This value is a global configuration parameter only. It cannot be
       overwritten by the execution host local configuration.

   <B>auto_user_oticket</B>
       The number of override tickets to assign to automatically created
       <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/user.html">user(5)</A></B> objects. User objects are created automatically if the
       <B>enforce_user</B> attribute is set to <I>auto</I>.

       Changing <B>auto_user_oticket</B> will affect any newly created user objects,
       but will not change user objects created in the past.

       This value is a global configuration parameter only. It cannot be
       overwritten by the execution host local configuration.

   <B>auto_user_fshare</B>
       The number of functional shares to assign to automatically created
       <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/user.html">user(5)</A></B> objects. User objects are created automatically if the
       <B>enforce_user</B> attribute is set to <I>auto</I>.

       Changing <B>auto_user_fshare</B> will affect any newly created user objects,
       but will not change user objects created in the past.

       This value is a global configuration parameter only. It cannot be
       overwritten by the execution host local configuration.

   <B>auto_user_default_project</B>
       The default project to assign to automatically created <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/user.html">user(5)</A></B> objects.
       User objects are created automatically if the <B>enforce_user</B> attribute is
       set to <I>auto</I>.

       Changing <B>auto_user_default_project</B> will affect any newly created user
       objects, but will not change user objects created in the past.

       This value is a global configuration parameter only. It cannot be
       overwritten by the execution host local configuration.

   <B>auto_user_delete_time</B>
       The number of seconds of inactivity after which automatically created
       <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/user.html">user(5)</A></B> objects will be deleted. User objects are created automatically
       if the <B>enforce_user</B> attribute is set to <I>auto</I>. If the user has no active
       or pending jobs for the specified amount of time, the object will
       automatically be deleted.  A value of 0 can be used to indicate that
       the automatically created user object is permanent and should not be
       automatically deleted.

       Changing <B>auto_user_delete_time</B> will affect the deletion time for all
       users with active jobs.

       This value is a global configuration parameter only. It cannot be
       overwritten by the execution host local configuration.

   <B>set_token_cmd</B>
       <B>Set_token_cmd</B> points to a command which sets and extends AFS tokens for
       Grid Engine jobs.  It is run <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_coshepherd.html">sge_coshepherd(8)</A></B>.  In the standard Grid
       Engine AFS distribution, it is supplied as a script which expects two
       command line parameters. It reads the token from STDIN, extends the
       token's expiration time and sets the token:

              &lt;set_token_cmd&gt; &lt;user&gt; &lt;token_extend_after_seconds&gt;

       As a shell script this command will call the programs:

              - SetToken
              - forge

       which are provided by your distributor as source code. The script looks
       as follows:

              --------------------------------
              #!/bin/sh
              # set_token_cmd
              forge -u $1 -t $2 | SetToken
              --------------------------------

       Since it is necessary for <I>forge</I> to read the secret AFS server key, a
       site might wish to replace the <B>set_token_cmd</B> script by a command, which
       connects to a custom daemon at the AFS server. The token must be forged
       at the AFS server and returned to the local machine, where <I>SetToken</I> is
       executed.

       Changing <B>set_token_cmd</B> will take immediate effect.  The default for
       <B>set_token_cmd</B> is none.

       The global configuration entry for this value may be overwritten by the
       execution host local configuration.

   <B>pag_cmd</B>
       The path to your <I>pagsh</I> is specified via this parameter.  The
       <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_shepherd.html">sge_shepherd(8)</A></B> process and the job run in a <I>pagsh</I>. Please ask your AFS
       administrator for details.

       Changing <B>pag_cmd</B> will take immediate effect.  The default for <B>pag_cmd</B>
       is none.

       The global configuration entry for this value may be overwritten by the
       execution host local configuration.

   <B>token_extend_time</B>
       The <B>token_extend_time</B> is the time period for which AFS tokens are
       periodically extended. Grid Engine will call the token extension 30
       minutes before the tokens expire until jobs have finished and the
       corresponding tokens are no longer required.

       Changing <B>token_extend_time</B> will take immediate effect.  The default for
       <B>token_extend_time</B> is 24:0:0, i.e. 24 hours.

       The global configuration entry for this value may be overwritten by the
       execution host local configuration.

   <B>shepherd_cmd</B>
       Alternative path to the <B>shepherd_cmd</B> binary. Typically used to call the
       shepherd binary by a wrapper script or command.

       Changing <B>shepherd_cmd</B> will take immediate effect. The default for
       <B>shepherd_cmd</B> is none.

       The global configuration entry for this value may be overwritten by the
       execution host local configuration.

   <B>gid_range</B>
       The <B>gid_range</B> is a comma-separated list of range expressions of the
       form n-m (n as well as m are integer numbers greater than 99), where m
       is an abbreviation for m-m. These numbers are used in <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> to
       identify processes belonging to the same job.

       Each <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> may use a separate set of group ids for this purpose.
       All numbers in the group id range have to be unused supplementary group
       ids on the system, where the <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> is started.

       Changing <B>gid_range</B> will take immediate effect.  There is no default for
       <B>gid_range</B>. The administrator will have to assign a value for <B>gid_range</B>
       during installation of Grid Engine.

       The global configuration entry for this value may be overwritten by the
       execution host local configuration.

   <B>qmaster_params</B>
       A list of additional parameters can be passed to the Grid Engine
       qmaster. The following values are recognized:

       <I>ENABLE</I><B>_</B><I>ENFORCE</I><B>_</B><I>MASTER</I><B>_</B><I>LIMIT</I>
              If this parameter is set then the <B>s_rt</B>, <B>h_rt</B> limits of a running
              job are tested and acted on by the <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B> when the
              <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> where the job was run is in an unknown state.

              After the <B>s_rt</B> or <B>h_rt</B> limit of a job is expired, the master
              daemon will wait additional time defined by <B>DURATION_OFFSET</B> (see
              <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sched_conf.html">sched_conf(5)</A></B>).  If the execution daemon still cannot be
              contacted when this additional time is elapsed, then the master
              daemon will force the deletion of the job (see <B>-f</B> of <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qdel.html">qdel(1)</A></B>).

              For jobs which will be deleted that way, an accounting record
              will be created.  For usage, the record will contain the last
              reported online value when the execution daemon could contact
              qmaster. The <B>failed</B> state in the record will be set to 37 to
              indicate that the job was terminated by a limit enforced by the
              master daemon.

              After the restart of <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B> the limit enforcement will
              be triggered after twice the biggest <B>load_report_interval</B>
              interval defined in <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_conf.html">sge_conf(5)</A></B> has elapsed. This will give the
              execution daemons enough time to re-register with the master
              daemon.

       <I>ENABLE</I><B>_</B><I>FORCED</I><B>_</B><I>QDEL</I><B>_</B><I>IF</I><B>_</B><I>UNKNOWN</I>
              If this parameter is set then a deletion request for a job is
              automatically interpreted as a forced deletion request (see <B>-f</B>
              of <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qdel.html">qdel(1)</A></B>) if the host where the job is running is in an
              unknown state.

       <I>ENABLE</I><B>_</B><I>FORCED</I><B>_</B><I>QDEL</I>
              If this parameter is set, non-administrative users can force
              deletion of their own jobs via the <I>-f</I> option of <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qdel.html">qdel(1)</A></B>.
              Without this parameter, forced deletion of jobs is only allowed
              by the Grid Engine manager or operator.

              <B>Note:</B> Forced deletion for jobs is executed differently,
              depending on whether users are Grid Engine administrators or
              not. In the case of administrative users, the jobs are removed
              from the internal database of Grid Engine immediately. For
              regular users, the equivalent of a normal <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qdel.html">qdel(1)</A></B> is executed
              first, and deletion is forced only if the normal cancellation
              was unsuccessful.

       <I>FORBID</I><B>_</B><I>RESCHEDULE</I>
              If this parameter is set, re-queueing of jobs cannot be
              initiated by the job script which is under control of the user.
              Without this parameter, jobs returning the value 99 are
              rescheduled. This can be used to cause the job to be restarted
              on a different machine, for instance if there are not enough
              resources on the current one.

       <I>FORBID</I><B>_</B><I>APPERROR</I>
              If this parameter is set, the application cannot set itself to
              the error state.  Without this parameter jobs returning the
              value 100 are set to the error state (and therefore can be
              manually rescheduled by clearing the error state).  This can be
              used to set the job to the error state when a starting condition
              of the application is not fulfilled before the application
              itself has been started, or when a clean up procedure (e.g. in
              the epilog) decides that it is necessary to run the job again.
              To do so, return 100 in the prolog, pe_start, job script,
              pe_stop or epilog script.

              If set to "true" or "1", the <I>reschedule</I><B>_</B><I>unknown</I> parameter is not
              taken into account.

       <I>ENABLE</I><B>_</B><I>RESCHEDULE</I><B>_</B><I>KILL</I>
              If set to "true" or "1", the <I>reschedule</I><B>_</B><I>unknown</I> parameter
              affects also jobs which have the rerun flag not activated (see
              the <B>-r</B> <B>y</B> option of <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B> and the <B>rerun</B> option of
              <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html">queue_conf(5)</A></B>), but they are just finished as they can't be
              rescheduled.

       <I>ENABLE</I><B>_</B><I>RESCHEDULE</I><B>_</B><I>SLAVE</I>
              If set to "true" or "1" Grid Engine triggers job rescheduling
              also when the host where the slave tasks of a parallel job
              executes is in unknown state, if the <I>reschedule</I><B>_</B><I>unknown</I>
              parameter is activated.

       <I>MAX</I><B>_</B><I>DYN</I><B>_</B><I>EC</I>
              Sets the max number of dynamic event clients (as used by <B>qsub</B>
              <B>-sync</B> <B>y</B> and by Grid Engine DRMAA API library sessions). The
              default is set to 99.  The number of dynamic event clients
              should not be bigger than half of the number of file descriptors
              the system has. The number of file descriptors are shared among
              the connections to all exec hosts, all event clients, and file
              handles that the qmaster needs.

       <I>MONITOR</I><B>_</B><I>TIME</I>
              Specifies the time interval when the monitoring information
              should be printed. The monitoring is disabled by default and can
              be enabled by specifying an interval.  The monitoring is per-
              thread and is written to the messages file or displayed by
              <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qping.html">qping(1)</A></B> with option <B>-f</B>.  Example: MONITOR_TIME=0:0:10 generates
              and prints the monitoring information approximately every 10
              seconds. The specified time is a guideline only and not a fixed
              interval. The interval that is actually used is printed.  In
              this example, the interval could be anything between 9 seconds
              and 20 seconds.

       <I>LOG</I><B>_</B><I>MONITOR</I><B>_</B><I>MESSAGE</I>
              Monitoring information is logged into the messages files by
              default. This information can be accessed via by <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qping.html">qping(1)</A></B>.  If
              monitoring is always enabled, the messages files can become
              quite large.  This switch disables logging into the messages
              files, making <I>qping</I> <I>-f</I> the only source of monitoring data.

       Profiling provides the user with the possibility to get system
       measurements.  This can be useful for debugging or optimization of the
       system. The profiling output will be done within the messages file.

       <I>PROF</I><B>_</B><I>SIGNAL</I>
              Enables the profiling for qmaster signal thread (e.g.
              PROF_SIGNAL=true).

       <I>PROF</I><B>_</B><I>WORKER</I>
              Enables the profiling for qmaster worker threads (e.g.
              PROF_WORKER=true).

       <I>PROF</I><B>_</B><I>LISTENER</I>
              Enables the profiling for qmaster listener threads (e.g.
              PROF_LISTENER=true).

       <I>PROF</I><B>_</B><I>DELIVER</I>
              Enables the profiling for qmaster event deliver thread (e.g.
              PROF_DELIVER=true).

       <I>PROF</I><B>_</B><I>TEVENT</I>
              Enables the profiling for qmaster timed event thread (e.g.
              PROF_TEVENT=true).

       Please note that the CPU utime and stime values contained in the
       profiling output are not per-thread CPU times.  These CPU usage
       statistics are per-process statistics.  So the printed profiling values
       for CPU mean "CPU time consumed by sge_qmaster (all threads) while the
       reported profiling level was active".

       <I>STREE</I><B>_</B><I>SPOOL</I><B>_</B><I>INTERVAL</I>
              Sets the time interval for spooling the sharetree usage. The
              default is set to 00:04:00. The setting accepts colon-separated
              string or seconds. There is no setting to turn the sharetree
              spooling off.  (e.g. STREE_SPOOL_INTERVAL=00:02:00)

       <I>MAX</I><B>_</B><I>JOB</I><B>_</B><I>DELETION</I><B>_</B><I>TIME</I>
              Sets the value of how long the qmaster will spend deleting jobs.
              After this time, the qmaster will continue with other tasks and
              schedule the deletion of remaining jobs at a later time. The
              default value is 3 seconds, and will be used if no value is
              entered. The range of valid values is &gt; 0 and &lt;= 5.  (e.g.
              MAX_JOB_DELETION_TIME=1)

       <I>gdi</I><B>_</B><I>timeout</I>'
              Sets how long the communication will wait for GDI send/receive
              operations.  (GDI is the Grid Engine Database Interface for
              interacting with objects managed by the qmaster.)  The default
              value is set to 60 seconds. After this time, the communication
              library will retry, if "gdi_retries" is configured, receiving
              the GDI request. If not configured the communication will return
              with a "gdi receive failure" (e.g. gdi_timeout=120 will set the
              timeout time to 120 sec).  Configuring no gdi_timeout value, the
              value defaults to 60 sec.

       <I>gdi</I><B>_</B><I>retries</I>
              Sets how often the GDI receive call will be repeated until the
              GDI receive error appears. The default is set to 0. In this case
              the call will be done 1 time with no retry.  Setting the value
              to -1 the call will be done permanently. In combination with the
              gdi_timeout parameter it is possible to configure a system with,
              e.g. slow NFS, to make sure that all jobs will be submitted.
              (E.g. gdi_retries=4.)

       <I>cl</I><B>_</B><I>ping</I>
              Turns on/off a communication library ping. This parameter will
              create additional debug output.  This output shows information
              about the error messages which are returned by communication and
              it will give information about the application status of the
              qmaster.  For example, if it's unclear what's the reason for gdi
              timeouts, this may show you some useful messages. The default
              value is false (off) (i.e. cl_ping=false).

       <I>SCHEDULER</I><B>_</B><I>TIMEOUT</I>
              Setting this parameter allows the scheduler GDI event
              acknowledge timeout to be manually configured to a specific
              value. Currently the default value is 10 minutes with the
              default scheduler configuration and limited between 600 and 1200
              seconds.  Value is limited only in case of default value.  The
              default value depends on the current scheduler configuration.
              The <I>SCHEDULER</I><B>_</B><I>TIMEOUT</I> value is specified in seconds.

       <I>jsv</I><B>_</B><I>timeout</I>
              This parameter measures the response time of the server JSV. In
              the event that the response time of the JSV is longer than the
              timeout value specified, this will cause the JSV to be re-
              started. The default value for the timeout is 10 seconds and if
              modified, must be greater than 0. If the timeout is reached, the
              JSV will only try to re-start once; if the timeout is reached
              again, an error will occur.

       <I>jsv</I><B>_</B><I>threshold</I>
              The threshold of a JSV is measured as the time it takes to
              perform a server job verification. If this value is greater than
              the user-defined value, it will cause logging to appear in the
              qmaster messages file at the INFO level. By setting this value
              to 0, all jobs will be logged in the qmaster messages file. This
              value is specified in milliseconds and has a default value of
              5000.

       <I>OLD</I><B>_</B><I>RESCHEDULE</I><B>_</B><I>BEHAVIOR</I>
              Beginning with version 8.0.0 of Grid Engine the scheduling
              behavior changed for jobs that are rescheduled by users.
              Rescheduled jobs will not be put at the beginning of the pending
              job list anymore. The submit time of those jobs is set to the
              end time of the previous run. Due to that, those rescheduled
              jobs will be appended to the pending job list as if a new job
              had been submitted. To achieve the old behaviour, set the
              parameter <I>OLD</I><B>_</B><I>RESCHEDULE</I><B>_</B><I>BEHAVIOR</I>. Please note that this
              parameter is deprecated, so it might be removed with the next
              minor release.

       <I>OLD</I><B>_</B><I>RESCHEDULE</I><B>_</B><I>BEHAVIOR</I><B>_</B><I>ARRAY</I><B>_</B><I>JOB</I>
              Beginning with version 8.0.0 of Grid Engine the scheduling
              behavior changed for array job tasks that are rescheduled by
              users. As soon as an array job task gets rescheduled, all
              remaining pending tasks of that job will be put at the end of
              the pending job list. To achieve the old scheduling behaviour
              set the parameter <I>OLD</I><B>_</B><I>RESCHEDULE</I><B>_</B><I>BEHAVIOR</I><B>_</B><I>ARRAY</I><B>_</B><I>JOB</I>. Please note
              that this parameter is deprecated, so it might be removed with
              the next minor release.

       Changing <B>qmaster_params</B> will take immediate effect, except that
       gdi_timeout, gdi_retries, and cl_ping will take effect only for new
       connections.  The default for <B>qmaster_params</B> is none.

       This value is a global configuration parameter only. It cannot be
       overwritten by the execution host local configuration.

   <B>execd_params</B>
       This is used for passing additional parameters to the Grid Engine
       execution daemon. The following values are recognized:

       <I>ACCT</I><B>_</B><I>RESERVED</I><B>_</B><I>USAGE</I>
              If this parameter is set to true, the  usage of reserved
              resources is used for the accounting entries <B>cpu</B>, <B>mem</B> and <B>io</B>
              instead of the measured usage.

       <I>ENABLE</I><B>_</B><I>WINDOMACC</I>
              If this parameter is set to true, Windows Domain accounts
              (WinDomAcc) are used on Windows hosts. These accounts require
              the use of <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/sgepasswd.html">sgepasswd(1)</A></B>.  (See also <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sgepasswd.html">sgepasswd(5)</A></B>.)  If this
              parameter is set to false, or is not set, local Windows accounts
              are used.  On non-Windows hosts, this parameter is ignored.

       <I>IGNORE</I><B>_</B><I>NGROUPS</I><B>_</B><I>MAX</I><B>_</B><I>LIMIT</I>
              If a user is assigned to NGROUPS_MAX-1 supplementary groups, so
              that Grid Engine is not able to add one for job tracking, then
              the job will go into an error state when it is started.
              (NGROUPS_MAX is the system limit on supplementary groups; see
              <B><A HREF="../htmlman7/limits.h.html">limits.h(7)</A></B>.)  Administrators that want to prevent the system
              doing so can set this parameter.  In this case the NGROUPS_MAX
              limit is ignored and the additional group (see <I>gid</I><B>_</B><I>range</I>) is not
              set. As a result for those jobs no online usage will be
              available. Also the parameter <I>ENABLE</I><B>_</B><I>ADDGRP</I><B>_</B><I>KILL</I> will have no
              effect.  Please note that it is not recommended to use this
              parameter. Instead the group membership of the submit user
              should be reduced.

       <I>KEEP</I><B>_</B><I>ACTIVE</I>
              This value should only be set for debugging purposes. If set to
              true, the execution daemon will not remove the spool directory
              maintained by <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_shepherd.html">sge_shepherd(8)</A></B> for a job.

       <I>PTF</I><B>_</B><I>MIN</I><B>_</B><I>PRIORITY</I>, <I>PTF</I><B>_</B><I>MAX</I><B>_</B><I>PRIORITY</I>
              The maximum/minimum priority which Grid Engine will assign to a
              job.  Typically this is a negative/positive value in the range
              of -20 (maximum) to 19 (minimum) for systems which allow setting
              of priorities with the <B><A HREF="../htmlman2/nice.html">nice(2)</A></B> system call. Other systems may
              provide different ranges.
              The default priority range (which varies from system to system)
              is installed either by removing the parameters, or by setting a
              value of -999.
              See the "messages" file of the execution daemon for the
              predefined default value on your hosts. The values are logged
              during the startup of the execution daemon.

       <I>PROF</I><B>_</B><I>EXECD</I>
              Enables the profiling for the execution daemon (e.g.
              PROF_EXECD=true).

       <I>NOTIFY</I><B>_</B><I>KILL</I>
              This parameter allows you to change the notification signal for
              the signal SIGKILL (see the <I>-notify</I> option of <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B>).  The
              parameter either accepts signal names (use the <I>-l</I> option of
              <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/kill.html">kill(1)</A></B>) or the special value <I>none</I>. If set to <I>none</I>, no
              notification signal will be sent. If it is set to <I>TERM</I>, for
              instance, or another signal name, then this signal will be sent
              as the notification signal.

       <I>NOTIFY</I><B>_</B><I>SUSP</I>
              With this parameter it is possible to modify the notification
              signal for the signal SIGSTOP (see the <I>-notify</I> parameter of
              <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B>).  The parameter either accepts signal names (use the <I>-l</I>
              option of <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/kill.html">kill(1)</A></B>) or the special value <I>none</I>. If set to <I>none</I>, no
              notification signal will be sent. If it is set to <I>TSTP</I>, for
              instance, or another signal name, then this signal will be sent
              as notification signal.

       <I>SHARETREE</I><B>_</B><I>RESERVED</I><B>_</B><I>USAGE</I>
              <B>Note:</B> Deprecated, may be removed in future release.
              If this parameter is set to true, the usage of reserved
              resources is taken for the Grid Engine share tree consumption
              instead of measured usage.
              <B>Note:</B> When running tightly integrated jobs with
              <I>SHARETREE</I><B>_</B><I>RESERVED</I><B>_</B><I>USAGE</I> set, and with <I>accounting</I><B>_</B><I>summary</I>
              enabled in the parallel environment, reserved usage will only be
              reported by the master task of the parallel job.  No per-
              parallel task usage records will be sent from execd to qmaster,
              which can significantly reduce load on qmaster when running
              large tightly integrated parallel jobs.

       <I>USE</I><B>_</B><I>QSUB</I><B>_</B><I>GID</I>
              If this parameter is set to true, the primary group id  active
              when a job was submitted will be set to become the primary group
              id for job execution. If the parameter is not set, the primary
              group id as defined for the job owner in the execution host
              passwd database is used.
              The feature is only available for jobs submitted via <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B>,
              <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qrsh.html">qrsh(1)</A></B>, <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qmake.html">qmake(1)</A></B> and <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qtcsh.html">qtcsh(1)</A></B>.  Also, it only works for <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qrsh.html">qrsh(1)</A></B>
              jobs (and thus also for <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qtcsh.html">qtcsh(1)</A></B> and <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qmake.html">qmake(1)</A></B>) If builtin
              communication is used, or the rsh and rshd components which are

       <I>S</I><B>_</B><I>DESCRIPTORS</I>, <I>H</I><B>_</B><I>DESCRIPTORS</I>, <I>S</I><B>_</B><I>MAXPROC</I>, <I>H</I><B>_</B><I>MAXPROC</I>, <I>S</I><B>_</B><I>MEMORYLOCKED</I>,
       <I>H</I><B>_</B><I>MEMORYLOCKED</I>, <I>S</I><B>_</B><I>LOCKS</I>, <I>H</I><B>_</B><I>LOCKS</I>
              Specifies soft and hard resource limits as implemented by the
              <B><A HREF="../htmlman2/setrlimit.html">setrlimit(2)</A></B> system call. See that manual page on your system
              for more information. These parameters complete the list of
              limits set by the RESOURCE LIMITS parameter of the queue
              configuration as described in <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html">queue_conf(5)</A></B>.  Unlike the
              resource limits in the queue configuration, these resource
              limits are set for every job on this execution host. If a value
              is not specified, the resource limit is inherited from the
              execution daemon process. Because this would lead to
              unpredictable results if only one limit of a resource is set
              (soft or hard), the corresponding other limit is set to the same
              value.
              <I>S</I><B>_</B><I>DESCRIPTORS</I> and <I>H</I><B>_</B><I>DESCRIPTORS</I> specify a value one greater than
              the maximum file descriptor number that can be opened by any
              process of a job.
              <I>S</I><B>_</B><I>MAXPROC</I> and <I>H</I><B>_</B><I>MAXPROC</I> specify the maximum number of processes
              that can be created by the job user on this execution host.
              <I>S</I><B>_</B><I>MEMORYLOCKED</I> and <I>H</I><B>_</B><I>MEMORYLOCKED</I> specify the maximum number of
              bytes of virtual memory that may be locked into RAM.
              <I>S</I><B>_</B><I>LOCKS</I> and <I>H</I><B>_</B><I>LOCKS</I> specify the maximum number of file locks any
              process of a job may establish.
              All of these values can be specified using the multiplier
              letters k, K, m, M, g and G; see <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/sge_types.html">sge_types(1)</A></B> for details.

       <I>INHERIT</I><B>_</B><I>ENV</I>
              This parameter indicates whether the shepherd should allow the
              environment inherited by the execution daemon from the shell
              that started it to be inherited by the job it's starting.  When
              true, any environment variable that is set in the shell which
              starts the execution daemon at the time the execution daemon is
              started will be set in the environment of any jobs run by that
              execution daemon, unless the environment variable is explicitly
              overridden, such as PATH or LOGNAME.  If set to false, each job
              starts with only the environment variables that are explicitly
              passed on by the execution daemon, such as PATH and LOGNAME.
              The default value is true.

       <I>SET</I><B>_</B><I>LIB</I><B>_</B><I>PATH</I>
              This parameter tells the execution daemon whether to add the
              Grid Engine shared library directory to the library path of
              executed jobs.  If set to true, and INHERIT_ENV is also set to
              true, the Grid Engine shared library directory will be prepended
              to the library path which is inherited from the shell which
              started the execution daemon.  If INHERIT_ENV is set to false,
              the library path will contain only the Grid Engine shared
              library directory.  If set to false, and INHERIT_ENV is set to
              true, the library path exported to the job will be the one
              inherited from the shell which started the execution daemon.  If
              INHERIT_ENV is also set to false, the library path will be
              empty.  After the execution daemon has set the library path, it
              may be further altered by the shell in which the job is
              executed, or by the job script itself.  The default value for
              SET_LIB_PATH is false.

       <I>ENABLE</I><B>_</B><I>ADDGRP</I><B>_</B><I>KILL</I>
              If this parameter is set then Grid Engine uses the supplementary
              group ids (see <I>gid</I><B>_</B><I>range</I>) to identify all processes which are to
              be terminated when a job is deleted, or when <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_shepherd.html">sge_shepherd(8)</A></B>
              cleans up after job termination.

       <I>PDC</I><B>_</B><I>INTERVAL</I>
              This parameter defines the interval between runs of the PDC
              (Portable Data Collector) by the execution daemon. The PDC is
              responsible for enforcing the resource limits s_cpu, h_cpu,
              s_vmem and h_vmem (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html">queue_conf(5)</A></B>) and job usage collection.
              The parameter can be set to a time_specifier (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_types.html">sge_types(5)</A></B>),
              to <B>PER_LOAD_REPORT</B> or to <B>NEVER</B>.
              If this parameter is set to <B>PER_LOAD_REPORT</B> the PDC is triggered
              in the same interval as <B>load_report_time</B> (see above). If this
              parameter is set to <B>NEVER</B> the PDC run is never triggered. The
              default is 1 second.
              <B>Note:</B> A PDC run is quite compute intensive, and may degrade the
              performance of the running jobs.  However, if the PDC runs less
              often, or never, the online usage can be incomplete or totally
              missing (for example online usage of very short running jobs
              might be missing) and the resource limit enforcement is less
              accurate or would not happen if PDC is turned off completely.

       <I>ENABLE</I><B>_</B><I>BINDING</I>
              If this parameter is set, then Grid Engine enables the core
              binding module within the execution daemon to apply binding
              parameters that are specified at submission time of a job. This
              parameter is not set by default, and therefore all binding-
              related information will be ignored.  Find more information for
              job to core binding in the section <I>-binding</I> of <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B>.

       Changing <B>execd_params</B> will take effect after it is propagated to the
       execution daemons. The propagation is done in one load report interval.
       The default for <B>execd_params</B> is none.

       The global configuration entry for this value may be overwritten by the
       execution host local configuration.

   <B>reporting_params</B>
       Used to define the behavior of reporting modules in the Grid Engine
       qmaster. Changes to the <B>reporting_params</B> take immediate effect.  The
       following values are recognized:

       <I>accounting</I>
              If this parameter is set to true, the accounting file is
              written.  The accounting file is a prerequisite for <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qacct.html">qacct(1)</A></B>.

       <I>reporting</I>
              If this parameter is set to true, the reporting file is written.
              The reporting file contains data that can be used for monitoring
              and analysis, like job accounting, job log, host load and
              consumables, queue status and consumables, and sharetree
              configuration and usage.  Attention: Depending on the size and
              load of the cluster, the reporting file can become quite large.
              Only activate the reporting file if you have a process running
              that will consume the reporting file!  See <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/reporting.html">reporting(5)</A></B> for
              further information about the format and contents of the
              reporting file.

       <I>flush</I><B>_</B><I>time</I>
              The contents of the reporting file are buffered in the Grid
              Engine qmaster and flushed at a fixed interval.  This interval
              can be configured with the <I>flush</I><B>_</B><I>time</I> parameter.  It is
              specified as a time value in the format HH:MM:SS.  Sensible
              values range from a few seconds to one minute. Setting it too
              low may slow down the qmaster. Setting it too high will make the
              qmaster consume large amounts of memory for buffering data.

       <I>accounting</I><B>_</B><I>flush</I><B>_</B><I>time</I>
              The contents of the accounting file are buffered in the Grid
              Engine qmaster and flushed at a fixed interval.  This interval
              can be configured with the <I>accounting</I><B>_</B><I>flush</I><B>_</B><I>time</I> parameter.  It
              is specified as a time value in the format HH:MM:SS.  Sensible
              values range from a few seconds to one minute. Setting it too
              low may slow down the qmaster. Setting it too high will make the
              qmaster consume large amounts of memory for buffering data.
              Setting it to 00:00:00 will disable accounting data buffering;
              as soon as data is generated, it will be written to the
              accounting file.  If this parameter is not set, the accounting
              data flush interval will default to the value of the <I>flush</I><B>_</B><I>time</I>
              parameter.

       <I>joblog</I> If this parameter is set to true, the reporting file will
              contain job logging information. See <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/reporting.html">reporting(5)</A></B> for more
              information about job logging.

       <I>sharelog</I>
              The Grid Engine qmaster can dump information about sharetree
              configuration and use to the reporting file.  The parameter
              <I>sharelog</I> sets an interval in which sharetree information will be
              dumped.  It is set in the format HH:MM:SS. A value of 00:00:00
              configures qmaster not to dump sharetree information. Intervals
              of several minutes up to hours are sensible values for this
              parameter.  See <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/reporting.html">reporting(5)</A></B> for further information about
              sharelog.

       <I>log</I><B>_</B><I>consumables</I>
              This parameter controls writing of consumable resources to the
              reporting file.  When set to (<B>log_consumables=true</B>) information
              about all consumable resources (their current usage and their
              capacity) will be written to the reporting file, whenever a
              consumable resource changes either in definition, or in
              capacity, or when the usage of a consumable resource changes.
              When <B>log_consumables</B> is set to <B>false</B> (default), only those
              variables will be written to the reporting file that are
              configured in the <B>report_variables</B> in the exec host
              configuration. See <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/host_conf.html">host_conf(5)</A></B> for further information about
              <B>report_variables</B>.

   <B>finished_jobs</B>
       <B>Note:</B> Deprecated, may be removed in a future release.
       Grid Engine stores a certain number of <I>just</I> <I>finished</I> jobs to provide
       post mortem status information via <I>qstat</I> <I>-s</I> <I>z</I>.  The <B>finished_jobs</B>
       parameter defines the number of finished jobs stored. If this maximum
       number is reached, the eldest finished job will be discarded for every
       new job added to the finished job list.

       Changing <B>finished_jobs</B> will take immediate effect.  The default for
       <B>finished_jobs</B> is 100.

       This value is a global configuration parameter only. It cannot be
       overwritten by the execution host local configuration.

   <B>qlogin_daemon</B>
   <B>qlogin_command</B>
   <B>rlogin_daemon</B>
   <B>rlogin_command</B>
   <B>rsh_daemon</B>
   <B>rsh_command</B>
       These three pairs of entries are responsible for defining a remote
       startup method for either interactive jobs by <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qlogin.html">qlogin(1)</A></B> or <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qrsh.html">qrsh(1)</A></B>
       <B>without</B> a command, or an interactive <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qrsh.html">qrsh(1)</A></B> request <B>with</B> a command.
       The last startup method is also used to startup tasks on a slave
       exechost of a tightly integrated parallel job.  Each pair for one
       startup method must contain matching communication methods. All entries
       can contain the value <B>builtin</B> (which is the default) or a full path to
       a binary which should be used, and additional arguments to this command
       if necessary.

       The entries for the three <B>..._command</B> definitions can, in addition,
       contain the value <B>NONE</B> in case a particular startup method should be
       disabled.

       Changing any of these entries will take immediate effect.

       The global configuration entries for these values may be overwritten by
       a execution host local configuration.

       See <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/remote_startup.html">remote_startup(5)</A></B> for a detailed explanation of these settings.

   <B>delegated_file_staging</B>
       This flag must be set to "true" when the prolog and epilog are ready
       for delegated file staging, so that the DRMAA attribute
       'drmaa_transfer_files' is supported. To establish delegated file
       staging, use the variables beginning with "$fs_..." in prolog and
       epilog to move the input, output and error files from one host to the
       other.  When this flag is set to "false", no file staging is available
       for the DRMAA interface. File staging is currently implemented only via
       the DRMAA interface.  When an error occurs while moving the input,
       output and error files, return error code 100 so that the error
       handling mechanism can handle the error correctly. (See also
       FORBID_APPERROR.)

   <B>reprioritize</B>
       <B>Note:</B> Deprecated, may be removed in future release.
       This flag enables or disables the reprioritization of jobs based on
       their ticket amount. The <B>reprioritize_interval</B> in <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sched_conf.html">sched_conf(5)</A></B> takes
       effect only if <B>reprioritize</B> is set to true. To turn off job
       reprioritization, the <B>reprioritize</B> flag must be set to false and the
       <B>reprioritize_interval</B> to 0, which is the default.

       This value is a global configuration parameter only. It cannot be
       overridden by the execution host local configuration.

   <B>jsv_url</B>
       This setting defines a server JSV instance which will be started and
       triggered by the <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B> process. This JSV instance will be used
       to verify job specifications of jobs before they are accepted and
       stored in the internal master database.  The global configuration entry
       for this value cannot be overwritten by execution host local
       configurations.

       Find more details concerning JSV in <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/jsv.html">jsv(1)</A></B> and <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/sge_request.html">sge_request(1)</A></B>.

       The syntax of the <B>jsv_url</B> is specified in <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/sge_types.html">sge_types(1)</A></B>.

   <B>jsv_allowed_mod</B>
       If there is a server JSV script defined with the <B>jsv_url</B> parameter,
       then all <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qalter.html">qalter(1)</A></B> or <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qmon.html">qmon(1)</A></B> modification requests for jobs are
       rejected by qmaster. With the <B>jsv_allowed_mod</B> parameter an
       administrator has the possibility to allow a set of switches which can
       then be used with clients to modify certain job attributes. The value
       for this parameter has to be a comma-separated list of JSV job
       parameter names as documented in <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B>, or the value <B>none</B> to indicate
       that no modification should be allowed.  Please note that even if <B>none</B>
       is specified, the switches <B>-w</B> and <B>-t</B> are allowed for qalter.

   <B>libjvm_path</B>
       <B>libjvm_path</B> is usually set during qmaster installation and points to
       the absolute path of libjvm.so (or the corresponding library depending
       on your architecture - e.g. /usr/java/jre/lib/i386/server/libjvm.so).
       The referenced libjvm version must be at least 1.5.  It is needed by
       the JVM qmaster thread only. If the Java VM needs additional starting
       parameters they can be set in <B>additional_jvm_args</B>. Whether the JVM
       thread is started at all can be defined in the <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/bootstrap.html">bootstrap(5)</A></B> file. If
       libjvm_path is empty, or an incorrect path, the JVM thread fails to
       start.

       The global configuration entry for this value may be overwritten by the
       execution host local configuration.

   <B>additional_jvm_args</B>
       <B>additional_jvm_args</B> is usually set during qmaster installation.
       Details about possible values <B>additional_jvm_args</B> can be found in the
       help output of the accompanying Java command. This setting is normally
       not needed.

       The global configuration entry for this value may be overwritten by the
       execution host local configuration.
