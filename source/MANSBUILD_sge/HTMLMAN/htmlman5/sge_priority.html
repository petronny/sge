       sge_priority - Grid Engine job priorities


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       Grid Engine provides a means for controlling job dispatch and run-time
       priorities. The dispatch priority indicates the relative importance of
       pending jobs and determines the order in which Grid Engine dispatches
       jobs to queue instances, if the relevant resources are available. The
       run-time priority determines the CPU allocation that the operating
       system assigns to jobs.

   <B>JOBS</B> <B>DISPATCH</B> <B>PRIORITY</B>
       A job's dispatch priority is affected by a number of factors:

       <B>o</B>  the identity of the submitting user

       <B>o</B>  the project under which the job is submitted (or alternatively, the
          default project of the submitting user)

       <B>o</B>  any resources requested by the job

       <B>o</B>  the job's submit time

       <B>o</B>  the job's initiation deadline time (if specified)

       <B>o</B>  the -p priority specified for the job (also known as the POSIX
          priority "pprio")

       The effect of each of these is governed by the overall policy setup,
       which is split into three top-level contributions.  Each of these is
       configured through the <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sched_conf.html">sched_conf(5)</A></B> parameters <B>weight_priority</B>,
       <B>weight_ticket</B> and <B>weight_urgency</B>.  These three parameters control to
       what degree POSIX priority, ticket policy, and urgency policy are in
       effect. To facilitate interpretation, the raw priorities
       ("tckts"/"urg"/"ppri") are normalized ("ntckts"/"nurg"/"npprior")
       before they are used to calculate job priorities ("prio").
       Normalization maps each raw urgency/ticket/priority  value into a range
       between 0 and 1.

          npprior = normalized(ppri)
          nurg    = normalized(urg)
          ntckts  = normalized(tckts)

          prio    = weight_priority * npprio +
                    weight_urgency  * nurg +
                    weight_ticket   * ntckts

       The higher a job's priority value, the earlier it gets dispatched.

       The urgency policy defines an urgency value for each job. The urgency
       value

          urg     =  rrcontr + wtcontr + dlcontr

       consists of the resource requirement contribution ("rrcontr"), the
       waiting time contribution ("wtcontr") and the deadline contribution
       ("dlcontr").

       The resource requirement contribution is adding up all resource
       requirements of a job into a single numeric value.

          rrcontr = Sum over all(hrr)

       with an "hrr" for each hard resource request.  Depending on the
       resource type, two different methods are used to determine the value to
       be used for "hrr" here. For numeric type resource requests, the "hrr"
       represents how much of a resource a job requests (on a per-slot basis
       for PE jobs) and how "important" this resource is considered in
       comparison to other resources. This is expressed by the formula:

          hrr      = rurg * assumed_slot_allocation * request

       where the resource's urgency value ("rurg") is as specified under
       <B>urgency</B> in <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/complex.html">complex(5)</A></B>, the job's assumed_slot_allocation represents the
       number of slots supposedly assigned to the job, and the per-slot
       request is that which was specified using the -l <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B> option. For
       string type requests the formula is simply

          hrr      = rurg

       and directly assigns the resource urgency value as specified under
       <B>urgency</B> in <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/complex.html">complex(5)</A></B>.

       The waiting time contribution represents a weighted waiting time of the
       jobs

          wtcontr = waiting_time * weight_waiting_time

       with the waiting time in seconds and the <B>weight_waiting_time</B> value as
       specified in <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sched_conf.html">sched_conf(5)</A></B>.

       The deadline contribution has an increasing effect as jobs approach
       their deadline initiation time (see the -dl option in <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B>).  It is
       defined as the quotient of the <B>weight_deadline</B> value from <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sched_conf.html">sched_conf(5)</A></B>
       and the (steadily decreasing) free time in seconds until deadline
       initiation time

          dlcontr = weight_deadline / free_time

       or is set to 0 for non-deadline jobs.  After the deadline passes, the
       value is static and equal to weight_deadline.

       The ticket policy unites functional, override and share tree policies
       in the ticket value ("tckts"), defined as the sum of the specific
       ticket values ("ftckt"/"otckt"/"stckt") for each sub-policy
       (functional, override, share):

           tckts = ftckt + otckt + stckt

       The ticket policies provide a broad range of means for influencing both
       job dispatch and runtime priorities on a per job, per user, per
       project, and per department basis. See the Grid Engine Installation and
       Administration Guide for details.

   <B>JOB</B> <B>RUN-TIME</B> <B>PRIORITY</B>
       The run-time priority can be dynamically adjusted in order to meet the
       goals set with the ticket policy. Dynamic run-time priority adjustment
       can be turned off (default) globally using <B>reprioritize_interval</B> in
       <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sched_conf.html">sched_conf(5)</A></B>.  If no dynamic run-time priority adjustment is done at a
       host level, the <B>priority</B> specification in <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html">queue_conf(5)</A></B> is in effect.

       Note that urgency and POSIX priorities do <B>not</B> affect runtime priority.
