<H2>NAME</H2><PRE>
       checkpoint - Grid Engine checkpointing environment configuration file
       format


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       Checkpointing is a facility to save the complete status of an executing
       program or job and to restore and restart from this so-called
       checkpoint at a later point of time if the original program or job was
       halted, e.g.  through a system crash.

       Grid Engine provides various levels of checkpointing support (see
       <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/sge_ckpt.html">sge_ckpt(1)</A></B>).  The checkpointing environment described here is a means
       to configure the different types of checkpointing in use for your Grid
       Engine cluster or parts thereof. For that purpose you can define the
       operations which have to be executed in initiating a checkpoint
       generation, a migration of a checkpoint to another host, or a restart
       of a checkpointed application, as well as the list of queues which are
       eligible for a checkpointing method.

       Supporting different operating systems may easily force Grid Engine to
       introduce operating system dependencies for the configuration of the
       checkpointing configuration file and updates of the supported operating
       system versions may lead to frequently changing implementation details.
       Please refer to the &lt;sge_root&gt;/ckpt directory for more information.

       Please use the <I>-ackpt</I>, <I>-dckpt</I>, <I>-mckpt</I> or <I>-sckpt</I> options to the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qconf.html">qconf(1)</A></B>
       command to manipulate checkpointing environments from the command-line
       or use the corresponding <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qmon.html">qmon(1)</A></B> dialogue for X-Windows based
       interactive configuration.

       Note, Grid Engine allows backslashes (\) be used to escape newline
       characters. The backslash and the newline are replaced with a space
       character before any interpretation.


</PRE>
<H2>FORMAT</H2><PRE>
       The format of a <I>checkpoint</I> file is defined as follows:

   <B>ckpt_name</B>
       The name of the checkpointing environment in the format for <I>ckpt</I><B>_</B><I>name</I>
       in <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/sge_types.html">sge_types(1)</A></B>.  To be used in the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B> <B>-ckpt</B> switch or for the
       <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qconf.html">qconf(1)</A></B> options mentioned above.

   <B>interface</B>
       The type of checkpointing to be used. Currently, the following types
       are valid:

       <I>hibernator</I>
              The Hibernator kernel level checkpointing is interfaced.

       <I>cpr</I>    The SGI kernel level checkpointing is used.

       <I>cray-ckpt</I>
              The Cray kernel level checkpointing is assumed.

       <I>transparent</I>
              Grid Engine assumes that the jobs submitted with reference to
              this checkpointing interface use a checkpointing library such as
              provided by the free package <I>Condor</I>.

       <I>userdefined</I>
              Grid Engine assumes that the jobs submitted with reference to
              this checkpointing interface perform their private checkpointing
              method.

       <I>application-level</I>
              Uses all of the interface commands configured in the
              checkpointing object like in the case of one of the kernel level
              checkpointing interfaces (<I>cpr</I>, <I>cray-ckpt</I>, etc.) except for the
              <B>restart_command</B> (see below), which is not used (even if it is
              configured) but the job script is invoked in case of a restart
              instead.

   <B>ckpt_command</B>
       A command-line type command string to be executed by Grid Engine in
       order to initiate a checkpoint.

   <B>migr_command</B>
       A command-line type command string to be executed by Grid Engine during
       a migration of a checkpointing job from one host to another.

   <B>restart_command</B>
       A command-line type command string to be executed by Grid Engine when
       restarting a previously checkpointed application.

   <B>clean_command</B>
       A command-line type command string to be executed by Grid Engine in
       order to cleanup after a checkpointed application has finished.

   <B>ckpt_dir</B>
       A file system location to which checkpoints of potentially considerable
       size should be stored.

   <B>ckpt_signal</B>
       A Unix signal to be sent to a job by Grid Engine to initiate checkpoint
       generation. The value for this field can either be a symbolic name from
       the list produced by the <I>-l</I> option of the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/kill.html">kill(1)</A></B> command or an integer
       number which must be a valid signal on the systems used for
       checkpointing.

   <B>when</B>
       The points of time when checkpoints are expected to be generated.
       Valid values for this parameter are composed from the letters <I>s</I>, <I>m</I>, <I>x</I>,
       <I>r</I> and any combinations thereof without any separating character in
       between. The same letters are allowed for the <I>-c</I> option of the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B>
       command which will overwrite the definitions in the used checkpointing
       environment.  The meaning of the letters is defined as follows:

       <I>s</I>      A job is checkpointed, aborted and if possible migrated if the
              corresponding <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> is shut down on the job's machine.

       <I>m</I>      Checkpoints are generated periodically at the <I>min</I><B>_</B><I>cpu</I><B>_</B><I>interval</I>
              interval defined by the queue (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html">queue_conf(5)</A></B>) in which a job
              executes.

       <I>x</I>      A job is checkpointed, aborted and, if possible, migrated as
              soon as the job gets suspended (manually as well as
              automatically).

       <I>r</I>      A job will be rescheduled (not checkpointed) when the host on
              which the job currently runs went into the "unknown" state and
              the time interval <I>reschedule</I><B>_</B><I>unknown</I> (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_conf.html">sge_conf(5)</A></B>) defined
              in the global/local cluster configuration is exceeded.



</PRE>
<H2>RESTRICTIONS</H2><PRE>
       <B>Note</B> that the functionality of any checkpointing, migration or restart
       procedures provided by default with the Grid Engine distribution, as
       well as the way how they are invoked in the <I>ckpt</I><B>_</B><I>command</I>, <I>migr</I><B>_</B><I>command</I>
       or <I>restart</I><B>_</B><I>command</I> parameters of any default checkpointing
       environments, should not be changed; otherwise the functionality
       remains the full responsibility of the administrator configuring the
       checkpointing environment.  Grid Engine will just invoke these
       procedures and evaluate their exit status. If the procedures do not
       perform their tasks properly, or are not invoked in a proper fashion,
       the checkpointing mechanism may behave unexpectedly; Grid Engine has no
       means to detect this.
