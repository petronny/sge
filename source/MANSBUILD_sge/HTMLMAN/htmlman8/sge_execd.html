<H2>NAME</H2><PRE>
       sge_execd - Grid Engine job execution agent


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       <B>sge_execd</B> [ <B>-help</B> ]


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <I>sge</I><B>_</B><I>execd</I> controls the Grid Engine queues local to the machine on which
       <I>sge</I><B>_</B><I>execd</I> is running and executes/controls the jobs sent from
       <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B> to be run on these queues.


</PRE>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
   <B>-help</B>
       Prints a listing of all options.

<H2>LOAD SENSORS</H2><PRE>
       If a <B>load</B> <B>sensor</B> is configured for <I>sge</I><B>_</B><I>execd</I> via either the global host
       configuration or the execution-host-specific cluster configuration (see
       <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_conf.html">sge_conf(5)</A></B>), the executable path of the load sensor is invoked by
       <I>sge</I><B>_</B><I>execd</I> on a regular basis and delivers one or multiple load figures
       for the execution host (e.g.  users currently logged in) or the
       complete cluster (e.g. free disk space on a network wide scratch file
       system). The load sensor may be a script or a binary executable. In
       either case its handling of the STDIN and STDOUT streams and its
       control flow must comply to the following rules:

       The load sensor must be written as an infinite loop waiting at a
       certain point for input from STDIN. If the string "quit" is read from
       STDIN, the load sensor should exit.  When an end-of-line is read from
       STDIN, a load data retrieval cycle should start. The load sensor then
       performs whatever operation is necessary to compute the desired load
       figures.  At the end of the cycle the load sensor writes the result to
       stdout. The format is as follows:

       <B>o</B>  A load value report starts with a line containing only either the
          word  "start" or the word "begin".

       <B>o</B>  Individual load values are separated by newlines.

       <B>o</B>  Each load value report consists of three parts separated by colons
          (":") and containing no blanks.

       <B>o</B>  The first part of a load value information is either the name of the
          host for which load is reported or the special name "global".

       <B>o</B>  The second part is the symbolic name of the load value as defined in
          the host or global complex list (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/complex.html">complex(5)</A></B> for details). If a
          load value is reported for which no entry in the host or global
          complex list exists, the reported load value is not used.

       <B>o</B>  The third part is the measured load value.

       <B>o</B>  A load value report ends with a line with only the word "end".


</PRE>
<H2>ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES</H2><PRE>
       <B>SGE_ROOT</B>       Specifies the location of the Grid Engine standard
                      configuration files.

       <B>SGE_CELL</B>       If set, specifies the default Grid Engine cell. To
                      address a Grid Engine cell <I>sge</I><B>_</B><I>execd</I> uses (in the order
                      of precedence):

                             The name of the cell specified in the environment
                             variable SGE_CELL, if it is set.

                             The name of the default cell, i.e. <B>default</B>.


       <B>SGE_DEBUG_LEVEL</B>
                      If set, specifies that debug information should be
                      written to stderr. In addition the level of detail in
                      which debug information is generated is defined.

       <B>SGE_QMASTER_PORT</B>
                      If set, specifies the tcp port on which <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B>
                      is expected to listen for communication requests.  Most
                      installations will use a services map entry for the
                      service "sge_qmaster" instead to define that port.

       <B>SGE_EXECD_PORT</B> If set, specifies the tcp port on which <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> is
                      expected to listen for communication requests.  Most
                      installations will use a services map entry for the
                      service "sge_execd" instead to define that port.


</PRE>
<H2>RESTRICTIONS</H2><PRE>
       <I>sge</I><B>_</B><I>execd</I> usually is started from root on each machine in the Grid
       Engine pool.  If started by a normal user, a spool directory must be
       used to which the user has read/write access. In this case only jobs
       being submitted by that same user are handled correctly by the system.


</PRE>
<H2>FILES</H2><PRE>
       <B>sgepasswd</B>  contains  a  list  of  user  names   and   their
       corresponding encrypted passwords. If available, the password  file
       will  be   used   by  <B>sge_execd</B>. To change the contents of this file
       please use the <B>sgepasswd</B> command. It is not advised to  change that
       file manually.
       <I>&lt;sge</I><B>_</B><I>root&gt;/&lt;cell&gt;/common/configuration</I>
                       Grid Engine global configuration
       <I>&lt;sge</I><B>_</B><I>root&gt;/&lt;cell&gt;/common/local</I><B>_</B><I>conf/&lt;host&gt;</I>
                       Grid Engine host specific configuration
