       SGE_Helper_Service.exe - Grid Engine job execution agent helper service

<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       <B>SGE_Helper_Service.exe</B> [ <B>-help</B> | <B>-install</B> | <B>-uninstall</B> ]

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <I>SGE</I><B>_</B><I>Helper</I><B>_</B><I>Service.exe</I> <I>helps</I> <I>the</I> <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> to run Windows jobs that
       request to be allowed to display their GUI on the visible Desktop. It
       is a Win32 service that is started at boot time under the SYSTEM
       account, giving it the permissions to give any process the permissions
       to access the visible Desktop.
       This service runs independently of the <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> (i.e. it is not
       started and stopped together with the execution daemon) and there can
       be only one SGE_Helper_Service.exe per host.
       Jobs can request to be allowed to display their GUI on the visible
       desktop by requesting the resource "display_win_gui" (qsub -l
       display_win_gui=1). See <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/submit.html">submit(1)</A></B> , option "-v", for information on how
       to set a job environment variable.
       When running GUI jobs, the environment variable SGE_BACKGND_MODE can be
       used to direct where the output of the GUI will be displayed. If the
       environment variable SGE_BACKGND_MODE is set to "TRUE" or "1" and "-l
       display_win_gui=true" is requested, the job is started by the helper
       service, but the GUI is not opened on the execution host's screen.
       Instead it is opened on a virtual screen.
