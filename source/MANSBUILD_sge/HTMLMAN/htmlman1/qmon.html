<H2>NAME</H2><PRE>
       qmon - X-Windows OSF/Motif graphical user interface for Grid Engine


</PRE>
<H2>SYNTAX</H2><PRE>
       <B>qmon</B> [options]


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <I>Qmon</I> allows administrators and users to manipulate the Grid Engine
       system from an X-Window environment.  <I>Qmon</I> provides various dialogues
       linked together in multiple ways.  For each task the user wishes to
       accomplish via <I>qmon</I> a corresponding dialogue is provided. There are
       multiple ways to address the proper dialogue for a certain task:

       <B>o</B>  The <I>qmon</I> main window that comes up first on start-up contains icon
          buttons for all major administrative and user tasks. A functionality
          tooltip is displayed when pointing at the different icons.

       <B>o</B>  A <B>Task</B> pulldown menu button appears in the <I>qmon</I> main window menu
          bar. Clicking on it opens a list of available tasks. Selecting one
          of them opens the corresponding dialogue.

       <B>o</B>  The <B>Task</B> pulldown menu also contains the key accelerators which can
          be used to invoke the task dialogues directly from the main window
          by pressing a certain sequence on the keyboard.

       <B>o</B>  While navigating through a certain dialogue and its dialogue sub-
          hierarchy, links to other dialogues occur whenever a connection
          between both dialogues is obvious. Pushing the buttons that identify
          the links opens up the other dialogues.


</PRE>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       The supported options are the standard X Toolkit options as described
       in <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/X.html">X(1)</A></B> section <B>Options</B>. Furthermore, <I>qmon</I> supports:

       <B>-cmap</B>  Installs a private color map for <I>qmon</I>.  This is sometimes useful
              if other applications have already allocated lots of colors and
              if <I>qmon</I>, therefore prints corresponding error messages. <B>Note</B>,
              however, that using a private color map will result in color map
              switches whenever you enter or leave <I>qmon</I> windows.

       <B>-fontFamily</B> <B>{big|medium|small}</B>
              Notifies <I>qmon</I> to use different size font families for different
              resolution sizes.

       <B>-help</B>  Displays usage information.

       <B>-nologo</B>
              Startup without logo.

<H2>DIALOGUES</H2><PRE>
   <B>Job</B> <B>Control</B>
       The <B>Job</B> <B>Control</B> dialogue provides a folder of tabulated lists of the
       still pending jobs, already running jobs and recently finished jobs.
       The dialogue allows for detailed information on the jobs as well as for
       the deletion and suspension of jobs being selected.  In addition the
       job control dialogue offers links to the <B>Submit</B> dialogue in order to
       submit new jobs or to change attributes of pending jobs (<B>Qalter</B>
       button). The fields displayed in the tabular display and the jobs
       displayed can be customized by pressing the <B>Customize</B> button. This
       customization can be saved to the <I>~/.qmon</I><B>_</B><I>preferences</I> file and is used
       on following startup for the initial configuration of the <B>Job</B> <B>Control</B>
       dialogue.


   <B>Queue</B> <B>Control</B>
       The <B>Queue</B> <B>Control</B> dialogue with its sub-dialogue hierarchy enables the
       user to control the status of the Grid Engine queues actually
       configured in the system and allows the administrator to add new queues
       or to modify or delete existing ones. The <B>Queue</B> <B>Control</B> dialogue shows
       a tabbed view of Cluster Queues or their corresponding Queue Instances
       in a tabular way.

       By pushing the <B>Add</B>, <B>Clone</B> or <B>Modify</B> button, a sub-dialogue for
       configuring Grid Engine queues is opened.  A queue needs to be selected
       to use the clone and modify operation. The configuration sub-dialogue
       allows for definition of the queue and its attributes.  The
       configuration sub-dialogue contains in the upper section the queue name
       and a list of hosts or hostgroups for which this queue contains the
       configuration.  The lower section contains a list of hosts or
       hostgroups at the left, where the default attributes are shown when the
       "@/" entry is highlighted.  These default attributes can be overruled
       on a hostgroup or host basis by enabling attributes and changing their
       values after this hostgroup or host entry has been added in the
       "Attributes for Host/Hostgroup" listbox.  The queue configuration
       parameters (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html">queue_conf(5)</A></B>) are subdivided into different categories
       (<B>General</B> <B>Configuration</B>, <B>Execution</B> <B>Methods</B>, <B>Checkpointing</B>, <B>Load/Suspend</B>
       <B>Thresholds</B>, <B>Limits</B>, <B>Complexes</B>, <B>User</B> <B>Access</B>, <B>Project</B> <B>Access,</B> <B>Subordinate</B>
       <B>Queues,</B> <B>Owners)</B> <B>which</B> <B>are</B> <B>selectable</B> <B>by</B> <B>the</B> <B>tab</B> <B>widget</B> <B>area</B> <B>presented</B>
       <B>in</B> <B>the</B> <B>lower</B> <B>region</B> <B>of</B> <B>the</B> <B>queue</B> <B>configuration</B> <B>sub-dialogue.</B>  <B>The</B>
       <B>administrator</B> <B>may</B> <B>select</B> <B>previously-configured</B> <B>settings</B> <B>from</B> <B>already</B>
       <B>existing</B> <B>queues</B> <B>(Clone</B> <B>button).</B> <B>By</B> <B>pushing</B> <B>the</B> <B>Ok</B> <B>button,</B> <B>the</B>
       <B>definitions</B> <B>are</B> <B>registered</B> <B>with</B> <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B>.  The <B>Queue</B> <B>Control</B>
       dialogue can be customized in a similar way as the <B>Job</B> <B>Control</B>
       dialogue. The settings applied here are also saved in
       <I>~/.qmon</I><B>_</B><I>preferences</I>.

   <B>Submit</B>
       The <B>Job</B> <B>Submission</B> dialogue serves for submitting batch and interactive
       jobs and is also invoked when changing attributes of pending jobs from
       the <B>Job</B> <B>Control</B> dialogue explained above (<B>Qalter</B> button). To toggle
       between batch and interactive jobs please use the <B>Batch/Interactive</B>
       button at the top of the button column on the right side of the <B>Job</B>
       <B>Submission</B> screen.

       The dialogue consists of a folder containing two job preparation
       dialogue pages. The most frequently used parameters in the course of a
       job submission are offered on the <B>General</B> page. A job script has to be
       defined; all other fields are optional. If the job demands
       specification of advanced requirements, the <B>Advanced</B> tab can be used to
       switch to an enhanced parameter display.

       If resource requirements are mandatory for the job, the <B>Request</B>
       <B>Resources</B> icon button has to be used to pop up the <B>Requested</B> <B>Resources</B>
       sub-dialogue.  This sub-dialogue allows for selection of the required
       resources of the job and for definition of the quantities in which this
       resources are to be provided. The <B>Available</B> <B>Resources</B> are constituted
       from those complex attributes declared <I>requestable</I> (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/complex.html">complex(5)</A></B> for
       details). Resource requirements can be made <B>Hard</B>, i.e. they must be met
       before a job can be started in a queue, or <B>Soft</B>, i.e. they are granted
       on an as-available basis.

       Closing the <B>Requested</B> <B>Resources</B> sub-dialogue with the done button books
       the specified requirement for the job. Pushing the <B>Submit</B> button on the
       top level <B>Submit</B> dialogue submits the job.

   <B>Complex</B> <B>Config</B>
       The <B>Complex</B> <B>Config</B> allows the administrator to add new complex
       attributes or to modify or delete existing ones (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/complex.html">complex(5)</A></B>).  The
       complex configuration dialogue provides a tabulated list of the complex
       attribute entries and an input region for the declaration of new or
       modified entries. The <B>Add</B> button updates the tabulated list with a new
       attribute.  The <B>Modify</B> button changes a highlighted existing entry.
       The <B>Delete</B> button removes the highlighted attributes.  The <B>Load</B> <B>and</B>
       <B>Save</B> buttons allow saving or reloading the whole attribute list to or
       from file.  The <B>Ok</B> button registers the additional or modified complex
       attributes with <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B>.

   <B>Host</B> <B>Config</B>
       Four types of host related lists can be maintained via the <B>Host</B> <B>Config</B>
       dialogue:

              Administration Hosts
              Submit Hosts
              Host Groups
              Execution Hosts

       The host list to be manipulated is selected via clicking at one of the
       tabs named correspondingly. The first two host lists only provide for
       adding or deleting entries, thereby allowing administrative or submit
       permission for the hosts on the lists, or denying it otherwise
       respectively.  The host group list allows the manipulation of host
       groups. Host groups can reference either other host groups or hosts.
       The execution host list entries in addition provide the ability to
       define scaling factors for the load sensors, consumable complex
       attributes and access attributes (access, xaccess and projects,
       xprojects) as described in <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/complex.html">complex(5)</A></B>.  CPU, memory and I/O usage
       reported for running jobs can be scaled in addition and the relative
       performance of a host can be defined with the <B>Resource</B> <B>Capability</B>
       <B>Factor</B> (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/host_conf.html">host_conf(5)</A></B>).

   <B>Cluster</B> <B>Config</B>
       This dialogue maintains the cluster global configuration as well as
       host specific derivatives (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_conf.html">sge_conf(5)</A></B>).  When opened, the dialogue
       displays a selection list for all hosts which have a configuration
       assigned. The special name "global" refers to the cluster global
       configuration. By pushing the <B>Add/Modify</B> button a sub-dialogue is
       opened, which allows for modification of the cluster configuration. For
       host specific configurations the 'global' host specific configuration
       fields are set insensitive and only the allowed parameters can be
       manipulated.

   <B>Scheduler</B> <B>Config</B>
       The <B>Scheduler</B> <B>Configuration</B> dialogue provides the means to change the
       behavior of the Grid Engine scheduler thread part of <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B>
       process.  The dialogue contains a representation for all scheduler
       configuration parameters as described in <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sched_conf.html">sched_conf(5)</A></B>.  It is
       subdivided in the two sections <B>General</B> <B>Parameters</B> and <B>Load</B> <B>Adjustments</B>,
       which can be selected via the corresponding tabs.  The <B>Ok</B> button
       registers any changes with <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B>.

   <B>Calendar</B> <B>Config</B>
       The <B>Calendar</B> <B>Config</B> allows the administrator to add new calendars or to
       modify or delete existing ones (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/calendar_conf.html">calendar_conf(5)</A></B>).  The dialogue
       offers a selection list for the existing calendars and displays the
       configuration of the one being selected. By pushing the <B>Delete</B> button,
       the selected calendar is deleted from the configuration. Pushing the
       <B>Add</B>/<B>Modify</B> button will open a calendar configuration dialogue, which
       allows to create new calendars or which provides the means to change
       the existing ones. The <B>Ok</B> button registers the additional or modified
       calendar with <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B>.

   <B>User</B> <B>Config</B>
       User permissions are controlled via the <B>User</B> <B>Config</B> dialogue.  The tab
       widget in the left section of the dialogue allows for selecting between

              Configuration of <B>Manager</B> accounts.
              Configuration of <B>Operator</B> accounts.
              Definition of <B>Usersets</B>.
              Definition of <B>User</B> accounts.

       Those user accounts added to the list of manager or operator accounts
       are given permission to act as managers or operators respectively when
       accessing Grid Engine under their own account.

       The userset lists are used together with the <B>user_lists</B> and <B>xuser_lists</B>
       host, queue, project and cluster configuration parameters (see
       <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html">queue_conf(5)</A></B>, <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/project.html">project(5)</A></B> and <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_conf.html">sge_conf(5)</A></B>) to control access of users
       to hosts, queues, projects and the entire cluster.  A userset is just a
       collection of user names and UNIX group names. Group names are
       identified by prefixing them with a "@" sign. The already-defined
       usersets are displayed in a selection list. These lists can be
       modified, and new lists can be created, using the <B>Userset</B> definition
       dialogue.

       Usersets can be used as <B>Access</B> <B>List</B> and/or as <B>Department</B> required for
       the so called <B>Functional</B> <B>Policy</B> and <B>Override</B> <B>Policy</B> (see <B>Ticket</B> <B>Config</B>
       below).

       User names can be added to the system as entries to the Grid Engine
       user database (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/user.html">user(5)</A></B>); here a default project can be attached to
       the user too.  This can be done with the <B>User</B> sub-dialogue.

       The <B>Tickets</B> button in the button list on the right side of the dialogue
       opens the <B>Ticket</B> <B>Config</B> dialogue (see below).

   <B>PE</B> <B>Config</B>
       Parallel environment (PE) interfaces can be configured with this
       dialogue.  PE interfaces are necessary to describe how parallel
       programming environments like PVM (Parallel Virtual Machine), MPI
       (Message Passing Interface), or shared memory parallel systems, are to
       be instantiated and to impose access restrictions onto the PEs. When
       the dialogue is opened a list of the configured PEs is displayed,
       together with the current configuration (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_pe.html">sge_pe(5)</A></B>) of the selected
       PE interface.  To add new PE interfaces, or to modify existing ones, an
       <B>Add</B> and a <B>Modify</B> button are available which open a PE interface
       configuration sub-dialogue. After applying the changes and quitting
       this sub-dialogue with the <B>OK</B> button, the new or modified PE interface
       is registered with <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B>.

   <B>Checkpoint</B> <B>Config</B>
       Checkpointing environment interfaces can be configured with this
       dialogue.  Checkpointing environments are necessary to describe the
       attributes which the different checkpointing methods and their
       derivatives on various operating system platforms supported by Grid
       Engine have. When the dialogue is opened a list of the already
       configured checkpointing environments is displayed together with the
       current configuration (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/checkpoint.html">checkpoint(5)</A></B>) of the selected checkpointing
       environment. To add new checkpointing environments, or to modify
       existing ones, an <B>Add</B> and a <B>Modify</B> button is available which opens a
       checkpointing environment configuration sub-dialogue. After applying
       the changes and quitting this sub-dialogue with the <B>OK</B> button, the new
       or modified checkpointing environment is registered with
       <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B>.

   <B>Ticket</B> <B>Conf</B>
       This dialogue offers an overview and editing screen for allocating
       tickets to the share-based, functional and override scheduling
       policies.

       The <B>Deadline</B> <B>Job</B> button opens the <B>User</B> <B>Conf</B> dialogue box.  Please
       change to the Userset sub-dialogue and select the userset named
       "deadlineusers".  Only users of this userset may submit deadline jobs.

       The <B>Share</B> <B>Tree</B> <B>Policy</B> button opens the dialogue for creating and
       editing the Grid Engine share tree (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/share_tree.html">share_tree(5)</A></B> and
       <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/schedd_conf.html">schedd_conf(5)</A></B> for a description of the configuration parameters).

       The <B>Functional</B> <B>Policy</B> button opens the dialogue for creating and
       editing the allocation of the functional shares (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sched_conf.html">sched_conf(5)</A></B>,
       <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/access_list.html">access_list(5)</A></B>, <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/project.html">project(5)</A></B>, <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html">queue_conf(5)</A></B> and <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/user.html">user(5)</A></B> for a description
       of the different types of functional shares and the configurable
       weighting parameters).

       The <B>Override</B> <B>Policy</B> button opens the dialogue for creating and editing
       the allocation of override tickets (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/access_list.html">access_list(5)</A></B>, <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/project.html">project(5)</A></B>,
       <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html">queue_conf(5)</A></B> and <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/user.html">user(5)</A></B> for a description of the different types of
       override tickets).

   <B>Project</B> <B>Conf</B>
       This button opens a dialog for creating projects.
       The dialogue offers a selection list for the existing projects and
       displays the configuration of the one being selected. By pushing the
       <B>Delete</B> button, the selected project is deleted from the configuration.
       Pushing the <B>Add</B>/<B>Modify</B> button will open a project configuration
       dialogue, which allows creating new projects changing existing ones.
       Project configuration in essence means giving or denying access to a
       project for usersets (see <B>User</B> <B>Conf</B> above as well as <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/project.html">project(5)</A></B>).  The
       Ok button registers the additional or modified project with
       <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B>.

   <B>Browser</B>
       The <B>Object</B> <B>Browser</B> dialogue's purpose is manifold: First of all, Grid
       Engine and <I>qmon</I> Messages, such as notification of error or success
       concerning a previously taken action, can be displayed in the
       dialogue's output window.  Also the standard output and the standard
       error output of <I>qmon</I> can be diverted to the <B>Object</B> <B>Browser</B> output
       window.

       Additionally the <B>Object</B> <B>Browser</B> can be used to display continuous
       information about Grid Engine objects as the mouse pointer moves over
       their representation as icons or table entries in other <I>qmon</I> dialogues.
       Currently, only the display of the configuration of two Grid Engine
       objects in two separate dialogues is supported:

       <B>o</B>  Queue configurations are displayed as soon as the mouse pointer
          enters a queue icon in the top level <B>Queue</B> <B>Control</B> dialogue (see
          above). This facility is activated by pushing the <B>Queue</B> button in
          the <B>Object</B> <B>Browser</B> dialogue.

       <B>o</B>  Detailed job information is printed as soon as the user moves the
          mouse pointer over a line in the <B>Job</B> <B>Control</B> dialogue (see above)
          assigned to a running or pending job.

       <B>o</B>  Additionally job scheduling information is displayed in the browser
          if the <B>Why?</B> button in the <B>Job</B> <B>Control</B> dialogue is pressed. In this
          case the Browser dialogue is opened implicitly and any scheduling
          related information is displayed.

   <B>Exit</B>
       The <B>Exit</B> icon button is not linked with a dialogue. Its sole purpose is
       to close all active <I>qmon</I> dialogues and to exit the application.


</PRE>
<H2>RESOURCES</H2><PRE>
       The available resources, their meaning and the syntax to be followed in
       order to modify them are described in the default <I>qmon</I> resource file
       (see the section <B>Files</B> below for the location of the resource file).


</PRE>
<H2>ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES</H2><PRE>
       <B>SGE_ROOT</B>       Specifies the location of the Grid Engine standard
                      configuration files.

       <B>SGE_CELL</B>       If set, specifies the default Grid Engine cell. To
                      address a Grid Engine cell <I>qmon</I> uses (in the order of
                      precedence):

                             The name of the cell specified in the environment
                             variable SGE_CELL, if it is set.

                             The name of the default cell, i.e. <B>default</B>.


       <B>SGE_DEBUG_LEVEL</B>
                      If set, specifies that debug information should be
                      written to stderr. In addition the level of detail in
                      which debug information is generated is defined.
