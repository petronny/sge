<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <I>qstat</I> shows the current status of the available Grid Engine queues and
       the jobs associated with the queues. Selection options allow you to get
       information about specific jobs, queues or users.  If multiple
       selections are done, a queue is only displayed if all selection
       criteria for a queue instance are met.  Without any option <I>qstat</I> will
       display only a list of jobs, with no queue status information.

       The administrator and the user may define files (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_qstat.html">sge_qstat(5)</A></B>),
       which can contain any of the options described below. A cluster-wide
       sge_qstat file may be  placed under
       $SGE_ROOT/$SGE_CELL/common/sge_qstat.  The user private file is
       searched for at the location $HOME/.sge_qstat.  The home directory
       request file has higher precedence than the cluster global file.  The
       command line can be used to override the flags contained in the files.


</PRE>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       <B>-explain</B> <B>a|A|c|E</B>
              'c' displays the reason for the c(onfiguration ambiguous) state
              of a queue instance. 'a' shows the reason for the alarm state.
              Suspend alarm state reasons will be displayed by 'A'. 'E'
              displays the reason for a queue instance error state.

              The output format for the alarm reasons is one line per reason,
              containing the resource value and threshold. For details about
              the resource value please refer to the description of the <B>Full</B>
              <B>Format</B> in section <B>OUTPUT</B> <B>FORMATS</B> below.

       <B>-ext</B>   Displays additional information for each job related to the job
              ticket policy scheme (see OUTPUT FORMATS below).

       <B>-f</B>     Specifies a "full" format display of information.  The <B>-f</B> option
              causes summary information on all queues to be displayed along
              with the queued job list.

       <B>-F</B> [ <B>resource_name,...</B> ]
              As for <B>-f</B>, information is displayed on all jobs as well as
              queues. In addition, <I>qstat</I> will present a detailed listing of
              the current resource availability per queue with respect to all
              resources (if the option argument is omitted) or with respect to
              those resources contained in the resource_name list. Please
              refer to the description of the <B>Full</B> <B>Format</B> in section <B>OUTPUT</B>
              <B>FORMATS</B> below for further detail.

       <B>-g</B> <B>{c|d|t}[+]</B>
              The <B>-g</B> option allows for controlling grouping of displayed
              objects.

              With <B>-g</B> <B>c</B> a cluster queue summary is displayed. Find  more
              information in the section <B>OUTPUT</B> <B>FORMATS</B>.

              With <B>-g</B> <B>d</B> array jobs are displayed verbosely in a one line per
              job task fashion. By default, array jobs are grouped and all
              tasks with the same status (for pending tasks only) are
              displayed in a single line. The array job task id range field in
              the output (see section <B>OUTPUT</B> <B>FORMATS</B>) specifies the
              corresponding set of tasks.

              With <B>-g</B> <B>t</B> parallel jobs are displayed verbosely in a one line
              per parallel job task fashion. By  default, parallel job tasks
              are displayed in a single line. Also with <B>-g</B> <B>t</B> option the
              function of each parallel task is displayed rather than the jobs
              slot amount (see section <B>OUTPUT</B> <B>FORMATS</B>).


       <B>-help</B>  Prints a listing of all options.

       <B>-j</B> <B>[job_list]</B>
              Prints either for all pending jobs or the jobs contained in
              job_list various information. The job_list can contain job_ids,
              job_names, or wildcard expression <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/sge_types.html">sge_types(1)</A></B>.

              For jobs in E(rror) state the error reason is displayed. For
              jobs that could not be dispatched during in the last scheduling
              interval the obstacles are shown, if 'schedd_job_info' in
              <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sched_conf.html">sched_conf(5)</A></B> is configured accordingly.

              For running jobs available information on resource utilization
              is shown about consumed cpu time in seconds, integral memory
              usage in Gbytes seconds, amount of data transferred in io
              operations, current virtual memory utilization in Mbytes, and
              maximum virtual memory utilization in Mbytes. This information
              is not available if resource utilization retrieval is not
              supported for the OS platform where the job is hosted.

              In combination with <B>-cp</B> the output of this command will
              additionally contain the information of a requested binding (see
              <B>-binding</B> of <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B>) and the changes that have been applied to
              the topology string (real binding) for the host where this job
              is running.

              The topology string will contain capital letters for all those
              cores that were not bound to the displayed job. Bound cores will
              be shown lowercase (E.g "SCCcCSCCcC" means that core 2 on the
              two available sockets where bound to this job).

              Please refer to the file &lt;sge_root&gt;/doc/load_parameters.asc for
              detailed information on the standard set of load values.

       <B>-l</B> <B>resource</B>[<B>=value</B>],...
              Defines the resources required by the jobs or granted by the
              queues on which information is requested. Matching is performed
              on queues based on non-mutable resource availability information
              only. That means load values are always ignored except the so-
              called static load values (i.e. "arch", "num_proc", "mem_total",
              "swap_total" and "virtual_total"). Consumable utilization is
              also ignored.  The pending jobs are restricted to jobs that
              might run in one of the above queues. In a similar fashion also
              the queue-job matching bases only on non-mutable resource
              availability information.  If there are multiple -l resource
              requests they will be concatenated by a logical AND: a queue
              needs to match all resources to be displayed.

       <B>-ne</B>    In combination with <B>-f</B> the option suppresses the display of
              empty queues. This means all queues where actually no jobs are
              running are not displayed.

       <B>-ncb</B>   In combination with <B>-ncb</B> the output of a command will suppress
              information of a requested binding and changes that have been
              applied to the topology string (real binding) for the host where
              the job is running.  This information will disappear in
              combination with the parameters <B>-r</B> and <B>-j</B>.

              Please note that this command line switch is intended to provide
              backward compatibility and will be removed in the next major
              release.

       <B>-pe</B> <B>pe_name,...</B>
              Displays status information with respect to queues which are
              attached to at least one of the parallel environments listed in
              the comma-separated option argument. Status information for jobs
              is displayed either for those which execute in one of the
              selected queues or which are pending and might get scheduled to
              those queues in principle.


       <B>-pri</B>   Displays additional information for each job related to the job
              priorities in general.  (see OUTPUT FORMATS below).

       <B>-q</B> <B>wc_queue_list</B>
              Specifies a wildcard expression queue list to which job
              information is to be displayed. Find the definition of
              <B>wc_queue_list</B> in <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/sge_types.html">sge_types(1)</A></B>.

       <B>-qs</B> <B>{a|c|d|o|s|u|A|C|D|E|S}</B>
              Allows for the filtering of queue instances according to state.

       <B>-r</B>     Prints extended information about the resource requirements of
              the displayed jobs.

              Please refer to the <B>OUTPUT</B> <B>FORMATS</B> sub-section <B>Expanded</B> <B>Format</B>
              below for detailed information.

       <B>-s</B> <B>{p|r|s|z|hu|ho|hs|hd|hj|ha|h|a}[+]</B>

              Prints only jobs in the specified state, any combination of
              states is possible. <B>-s</B> <B>prs</B> corresponds to the regular <I>qstat</I>
              output without <B>-s</B> at all. To show recently finished jobs, use <B>-s</B>
              <B>z</B>.  To display jobs in user/operator/system/array-dependency
              hold, use the <B>-s</B> <B>hu/ho/hs/hd</B> option. The <B>-s</B> <B>ha</B> option shows jobs
              which where submitted with the <I>qsub</I> <B>-a</B> command.  <I>qstat</I> <B>-s</B> <B>hj</B>
              displays all jobs which are not eligible for execution unless
              the job has entries in the job dependency list.  <I>qstat</I> <B>-s</B> <B>h</B> is
              an abbreviation for <I>qstat</I> <B>-s</B> <B>huhohshdhjha</B> and <I>qstat</I> <B>-s</B> <B>a</B> is an
              abbreviation for <I>qstat</I> <B>-s</B> <B>psr</B> (see <B>-a</B>, <B>-hold_jid</B> and
              <B>-hold_jid_ad</B> options to <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B>).

       <B>-t</B>     Prints extended information about the controlled sub-tasks of
              the displayed parallel jobs. Please refer to the <B>OUTPUT</B> <B>FORMATS</B>
              sub-section <B>Reduced</B> <B>Format</B> below for detailed information. Sub-
              tasks of parallel jobs should not be confused with array job
              tasks (see <B>-g</B> option above and <B>-t</B> option to <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B>).

       <B>-U</B> <B>user,...</B>
              Displays status information with respect to queues to which the
              specified users have access. Status information for jobs is
              displayed either for those which execute in one of the selected
              queues or which are pending and might get scheduled to those
              queues in principle.

       <B>-u</B> <B>user,...</B>
              Display information only on those jobs and queues being
              associated with the users from the given user list.  Queue
              status information is displayed if the <B>-f</B> or <B>-F</B> options are
              specified additionally and if the user runs jobs in those
              queues.

              The string  <B>$user</B> is a placeholder for the current username. An
              asterisk "*" can be used as username wildcard to request any
              users' jobs be displayed. The default value for this switch is
              <B>-u</B> <B>$user</B>.


       <B>-urg</B>   Displays additional information for each job related to the job
              urgency policy scheme (see OUTPUT FORMATS below).

       <B>-xml</B>   This option can be used with all other options and changes the
              output to XML. The used schemas are referenced in the XML
              output. The output is printed to stdout.  For more detailed
              information, the schemas for the qstat command can be found in
              $SGE_ROOT/util/resources/schemas/qstat.

              If the <B>-xml</B> parameter is combined with <B>-ncb</B> then the XML output
              does not contain tags with information about job to core
              binding.  You can also find schema files with the suffix "_ncb"
              in the directory $SGE_ROOT/util/resources/schemas/qstat that
              describe that changes.


</PRE>
<H2>OUTPUT FORMATS</H2><PRE>
       Depending on the presence or absence of the <B>-explain</B>, <B>-f</B>, <B>-F</B>, or <B>-qs</B>
       and <B>-r</B> and <B>-t</B> option three output formats need to be differentiated.

       The <B>-ext</B> and <B>-urg</B> options may be used to display additional information
       for each job.

   <B>Cluster</B> <B>Queue</B> <B>Format</B> <B>(with</B> <B>-g</B> <B>c)</B>
       Following the header line a section for each cluster queue is provided.
       When queue instances selection are applied (-l -pe, -q, -U) the cluster
       format contains only cluster queues of the corresponding queue
       instances.

       <B>o</B>  the cluster queue name.

       <B>o</B>  an average of the normalized load average of all queue hosts. In
          order to reflect each hosts different significance the number of
          configured slots is used as a weighting factor when determining
          cluster queue load.  Please note that only hosts with a
          np_load_value are considered for this value. When queue selection is
          applied only data about selected queues is considered in this
          formula. If the load value is not available at any of the hosts
          '-NA-' is printed instead of the value from the complex attribute
          definition.

       <B>o</B>  the number of currently used slots.

       <B>o</B>  the number of slots reserved in advance.

       <B>o</B>  the number of currently available slots.

       <B>o</B>  the total number of slots.

       <B>o</B>  the number of slots which is in at least one of the states  'aoACDS'
          and in none of the states 'cdsuE'

       <B>o</B>  the number of slots which are in one of these states or in any
          combination of them: 'cdsuE'

       <B>o</B>  the <B>-g</B> <B>c</B> option can be used in combination with <B>-ext</B>. In this case,
          additional columns are added to the output. Each column contains the
          slot count for one of the available queue states.

   <B>Reduced</B> <B>Format</B> <B>(without</B> <B>-f,</B> <B>-F,</B> <B>and</B> <B>-qs)</B>
       Following the header line a line is printed for each job consisting of

       <B>o</B>  the job ID.

       <B>o</B>  the priority of the job determining its position in the pending jobs
          list.  The priority value is determined dynamically based on ticket
          and urgency policy set-up (see also <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_priority.html">sge_priority(5)</A></B> ).

       <B>o</B>  the name of the job.

       <B>o</B>  the user name of the job owner.

       <B>o</B>  the status of the job - one of d(eletion), E(rror), h(old),
          r(unning), R(estarted), s(uspended), S(uspended), t(ransfering),
          T(hreshold) or w(aiting).

          The state d(eletion) indicates that a <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qdel.html">qdel(1)</A></B> has been used to
          initiate job deletion.  The states t(ransfering) and r(unning)
          indicate that a job is about to be executed or is already executing,
          whereas the states s(uspended), S(uspended) and T(hreshold) show
          that an already running jobs has been suspended. The s(uspended)
          state is caused by suspending the job via the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qmod.html">qmod(1)</A></B> command, the
          S(uspended) state indicates that the queue containing the job is
          suspended and therefore the job is also suspended and the
          T(hreshold) state shows that at least one suspend threshold of the
          corresponding queue was exceeded (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html">queue_conf(5)</A></B>) and that the
          job has been suspended as a consequence. The state R(estarted)
          indicates that the job was restarted. This can be caused by a job
          migration or because of one of the reasons described in the -r
          section of the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B> command.

          The states w(aiting) and h(old) only appear for pending jobs. The
          h(old) state indicates that a job currently is not eligible for
          execution due to a hold state assigned to it via <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qhold.html">qhold(1)</A></B>, <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qalter.html">qalter(1)</A></B>
          or the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B> <B>-h</B> option or that the job is waiting for completion
          of the jobs to which job dependencies have been assigned to the job
          via the <B>-hold_jid</B> or <B>-hold_jid-ad</B> options of <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B> or <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qalter.html">qalter(1)</A></B>.

          The state E(rror) appears for pending jobs that couldn't be started
          due to job properties. The reason for the job error is shown by the
          <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qstat.html">qstat(1)</A></B> <B>-j</B> <B>job_list</B> option.

       <B>o</B>  the submission or start time and date of the job.

       <B>o</B>  the queue the job is assigned to (for running or suspended jobs
          only).

       <B>o</B>  the number of job slots or the function of parallel job tasks if <B>-g</B>
          <B>t</B> is specified.

          Without <B>-g</B> <B>t</B> option the total number of slots occupied resp.
          requested by the job is displayed. For pending parallel jobs with a
          PE slot range request, the assumed future slot allocation is
          displayed.  With <B>-g</B> <B>t</B> option the function of the running jobs
          (MASTER or SLAVE - the latter for parallel jobs only) is displayed.

       <B>o</B>  the array job task id. Will be empty for non-array jobs. See the <B>-t</B>
          option to <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B> and the <B>-g</B> above for additional information.

       If the <B>-t</B> option is supplied, each status line always contains parallel
       job task information as if <B>-g</B> <B>t</B> were specified and each line contains
       the following parallel job subtask information:

       <B>o</B>  the parallel task ID (do not confuse parallel tasks with array job

          x(exited).

       Following the header line a section for each queue separated by a
       horizontal line is provided. For each queue the information printed
       consists of

       <B>o</B>  the queue name,

       <B>o</B>  the queue type - one of B(atch), I(nteractive), C(heckpointing),
          P(arallel), or combinations thereof or N(one),

       <B>o</B>  the number of used and available job slots,

       <B>o</B>  the load average of the queue host,

       <B>o</B>  the architecture of the queue host and

       <B>o</B>  the state of the queue - one of u(nknown) if the corresponding
          <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> cannot be contacted, a(larm), A(larm), C(alendar
          suspended), s(uspended), S(ubordinate), d(isabled), D(isabled),
          E(rror) or combinations thereof.

       If the state is a(larm) at least on of the load thresholds defined in
       the <I>load</I><B>_</B><I>thresholds</I> list of the queue configuration (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html">queue_conf(5)</A></B>)
       is currently exceeded, which prevents from scheduling further jobs to
       that queue.

       As opposed to this, the state A(larm) indicates that at least one of
       the suspend thresholds of the queue (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html">queue_conf(5)</A></B>) is currently
       exceeded. This will result in jobs running in that queue being
       successively suspended until no threshold is violated.

       The states s(uspended) and d(isabled) can be assigned to queues and
       released via the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qmod.html">qmod(1)</A></B> command. Suspending a queue will cause all
       jobs executing in that queue to be suspended.

       The states D(isabled) and C(alendar suspended) indicate that the queue
       has been disabled or suspended automatically via the calendar facility
       of Grid Engine (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/calendar_conf.html">calendar_conf(5)</A></B>), while the S(ubordinate) state
       indicates, that the queue has been suspended via subordination to
       another queue (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html">queue_conf(5)</A></B> for details). When suspending a queue
       (regardless of the cause) all jobs executing in that queue are
       suspended too.

       The state P(reempted) indicates that the queue has been disabled via
       slotwise subordination to another queue, preventing it getting jobs
       which would simply be suspended.

       If an E(rror) state is displayed for a queue, <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> on that host
       was unable to locate the <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_shepherd.html">sge_shepherd(8)</A></B> executable on that host in
       order to start a job. Please check the error logfile of that
       <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> for leads on how to resolve the problem. Please enable the
       queue afterwards via the <B>-c</B> option of the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qmod.html">qmod(1)</A></B> command manually.

       If the c(onfiguration ambiguous) state is displayed for a queue
       instance this indicates that the configuration specified for this queue
       instance in <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_conf.html">sge_conf(5)</A></B> is ambiguous. This state is cleared when the
       configuration becomes unambiguous again. This state prevents further
       jobs from being scheduled to that queue instance. Detailed reasons why
       a queue instance entered the c(onfiguration ambiguous) state can be
       found in the <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B> messages file and are shown by the qstat
       -explain switch. For queue instances in this state the cluster queue's
       default settings are used for the ambiguous attribute.

       If an o(rphaned) state is displayed for a queue instance, it indicates
       that the queue instance is no longer demanded by the current cluster
       queue's configuration or the host group configuration.  The queue
       instance is kept because jobs which not yet finished jobs are still
       associated with it, and it will vanish from qstat output when these
       jobs have finished. To quicken vanishing of an orphaned queue instance
       associated job(s) can be deleted using <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qdel.html">qdel(1)</A></B>.  A queue instance in
       (o)rphaned state can be revived by changing the cluster queue
       configuration accordingly to cover that queue instance. This state
       prevents from scheduling further jobs to that queue instance.

       If the <B>-F</B> option was used, resource availability information is printed
       following the queue status line. For each resource (as selected in an
       option argument to <B>-F</B> or for all resources if the option argument was
       omitted) a single line is displayed with the following format:

       <B>o</B>  a one letter specifier indicating whether the current resource
          availability value was dominated by either
          `<B>g</B>' - a cluster global,
          `<B>h</B>' - a host total or
          `<B>q</B>' - a queue related resource consumption.

       <B>o</B>  a second one letter specifier indicating the source for the current
          resource availability value, being one of
          `<B>l</B>' - a load value reported for the resource,
          `<B>L</B>' - a load value for the resource after administrator defined load
          scaling has been applied,
          `<B>c</B>' - availability derived from the consumable resources facility
          (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/complexes.html">complexes(5)</A></B>),
          `<B>f</B>' - a fixed availability definition derived from a non-consumable
          complex attribute or a fixed resource limit.

       <B>o</B>  after a colon the name of the resource on which information is
          displayed.

       <B>o</B>  after an equal sign the current resource availability value.

       The displayed availability values and the sources from which they
       derive are always the minimum values of all possible combinations.
       Hence, for example, a line of the form "qf:h_vmem=4G" indicates that a
       queue currently has a maximum availability in virtual memory of 4
       Gigabyte, where this value is a fixed value (e.g. a resource limit in
       the queue configuration) and it is queue dominated, i.e. the host in
       total may have more virtual memory available than this, but the queue
       doesn't allow for more. Contrarily a line "hl:h_vmem=4G" would also
       indicate an upper bound of 4 Gigabyte virtual memory availability, but
       the limit would be derived from a load value currently reported for the
       host. So while the queue might allow for jobs with higher virtual
       memory requirements, the host on which this particular queue resides
       currently only has 4 Gigabyte available.

       If the <B>-explain</B> option was used with the character 'a' or 'A',
       information about resources is displayed, that violate load or suspend
       thresholds.
       The same format as with the <B>-F</B> option is used with following
       extensions:

       <B>o</B>  the line starts with the keyword `alarm'

       <B>o</B>  appended to the resource value is the type and value of the
          appropriate threshold

       After the queue status line (in case of <B>-f</B>) or the resource
       availability information (in case of <B>-F</B>) a single line is printed for
       each job running currently in this queue. Each job status line contains

       <B>o</B>  the job ID,

       <B>o</B>  the priority of the job determining its position in the pending jobs
          list.  The priority value is determined dynamically based on ticket
          and urgency policy set-up (see also <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_priority.html">sge_priority(5)</A></B> ).

       <B>o</B>  the job name,

       <B>o</B>  the job owner name,

       <B>o</B>  the status of the job - one of t(ransfering), r(unning),
          R(estarted), s(uspended), S(uspended) or T(hreshold) (see the
          <B>Reduced</B> <B>Format</B> section for detailed information),

       <B>o</B>  the submission or start time and date of the job.

       <B>o</B>  the number of job slots or the function of parallel job tasks if <B>-g</B>
          <B>t</B> is specified.

          Without <B>-g</B> <B>t</B> option the number of slots occupied per queue resp.
          requested by the job is displayed. For pending parallel jobs with a
          PE slot range request, the assumed future slot allocation is
          displayed.  With <B>-g</B> <B>t</B> option the function of the running jobs
          (MASTER or SLAVE - the latter for parallel jobs only) is displayed.

       If the <B>-t</B> option is supplied, each job status line also contains

       <B>o</B>  the task ID,

       <B>o</B>  the status of the task - one of r(unning), R(estarted), s(uspended),
          S(uspended), T(hreshold), w(aiting), h(old), or x(exited) (see the
          <B>Reduced</B> <B>Format</B> section for detailed information),

       <B>o</B>  the cpu, memory, and I/O usage,

       <B>o</B>  the exit status of the task,

       <B>o</B>  and the failure code and message for the task.

       Following the list of queue sections a <I>PENDING</I> <I>JOBS</I> list may be printed
       in case jobs are waiting for being assigned to a queue.  A status line
       for each waiting job is displayed being similar to the one for the
       running jobs. The differences are that the status for the jobs is
       w(aiting) or h(old), that the submit time and date is shown instead of
       the start time and that no function is displayed for the jobs.

       In very rare cases, e.g. if <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B> starts up from an
       inconsistent state in the job or queue spool files or if the <B>clean</B>
       <B>queue</B> (<B>-cq</B>) option of <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qconf.html">qconf(1)</A></B> is used, <I>qstat</I> cannot assign jobs to
       either the running or pending jobs section of the output. In this case
       as job status inconsistency (e.g. a job has a running status but is not
       assigned to a queue) has been detected. Such jobs are printed in an
       <I>ERROR</I> <I>JOBS</I> section at the very end of the output. The ERROR JOBS
       section should disappear upon restart of <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B>.  Please
       contact your Grid Engine support representative if you feel uncertain
       about the cause or effects of such jobs.

   <B>Expanded</B> <B>Format</B> <B>(with</B> <B>-r)</B>
       If the <B>-r</B> option was specified together with <I>qstat</I>, the following
       information for each displayed job is printed (a single line for each
       of the following job characteristics):

       <B>o</B>  The job and master queue name.

       <B>o</B>  The hard and soft resource requirements of the job as specified with
          the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B> <B>-l</B> option. The per resource addend when determining the
          jobs urgency contribution value is printed (see also
          <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_priority.html">sge_priority(5)</A></B>).

       <B>o</B>  The requested parallel environment including the desired queue slot

<H2>ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES</H2><PRE>
       <B>SGE_ROOT</B>       Specifies the location of the Grid Engine standard
                      configuration files.

       <B>SGE_CELL</B>       If set, specifies the default Grid Engine cell. To
                      address a Grid Engine cell <I>qstat</I> uses (in the order of
                      precedence):

                             The name of the cell specified in the environment
                             variable SGE_CELL, if it is set.

                             The name of the default cell, i.e. <B>default</B>.


       <B>SGE_DEBUG_LEVEL</B>
                      If set, specifies that debug information should be
                      written to stderr. In addition the level of detail in
                      which debug information is generated is defined.

       <B>SGE_QMASTER_PORT</B>
                      If set, specifies the tcp port on which <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B>
                      is expected to listen for communication requests.  Most
                      installations will use a services map entry for the
                      service "sge_qmaster" instead to define that port.

       <B>SGE_LONG_QNAMES</B>
                      Qstat does display queue names up to 30 characters. If
                      that is to much or not enough, one can set a custom
                      length with this variable. The minimum display length is
                      10 characters. If one does not know the best display
                      length, one can set SGE_LONG_QNAMES to -1 and qstat will
                      figure out the best length.
