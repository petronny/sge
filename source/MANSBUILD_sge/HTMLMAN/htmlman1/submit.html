<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <I>Qsub</I> submits batch jobs to the Grid Engine queuing system. Grid Engine
       supports single- and multiple-node jobs. <B>Command</B> can be a path to a
       binary or a script (see <B>-b</B> below) which contains the commands to be run
       by the job using a shell (for example, <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/sh.html">sh(1)</A></B> or <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/csh.html">csh(1)</A></B>).  Arguments to
       the command are given as <B>command_args</B> to <I>qsub</I> <I>.</I>  If <B>command</B> is handled
       as a script then it is possible to embed flags in the script.  If the
       first two characters of a script line either match '#$' or are equal to
       the prefix string defined with the <B>-C</B> option described below, the line
       is parsed for embedded command flags.

       <I>Qsh</I> submits an interactive X-windows session to Grid Engine. An
       <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/xterm.html">xterm(1)</A></B> is brought up from the executing machine with the display
       directed either to the X-server indicated by the DISPLAY environment
       variable or as specified with the <I>-display</I> <I>qsh</I> option. Interactive jobs
       are not spooled if no resource is available to execute them. They are
       either dispatched to a suitable machine for execution immediately or
       the user submitting the job is notified by <I>qsh</I> that appropriate
       resources to execute the job are not available.  <B>xterm_args</B> are passed
       to the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/xterm.html">xterm(1)</A></B> executable.  Note, however, that the <I>-e</I> and <I>-ls</I> xterm
       options do not work with <I>qsh</I>.

       <I>Qlogin</I> is similar to <I>qsh</I> in that it submits an interactive job to the
       queuing system. It does not open an <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/xterm.html">xterm(1)</A></B> window on the X display,
       but uses the current terminal for user I/O. Usually, <I>qlogin</I> establishes
       a <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/telnet.html">telnet(1)</A></B> connection with the remote host, using standard client- and
       server-side commands. These commands can be configured with the
       <B>qlogin_daemon</B> (server-side, Grid Engine <I>telnetd</I> if not set, otherwise
       something like /usr/sbin/in.telnetd) and <B>qlogin_command</B> (client-side,
       Grid Engine <I>telnet</I> if not set, otherwise something like
       /usr/bin/telnet) parameters in the global and local configuration
       settings of <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_conf.html">sge_conf(5)</A></B>.  The client side command is automatically
       parameterized with the remote host name and port number to which to
       connect, resulting in an invocation like

              /usr/bin/telnet my_exec_host 2442

       for example.  <I>Qlogin</I> is invoked exactly like <I>qsh</I> and its jobs can only
       run on INTERACTIVE queues.  <I>Qlogin</I> jobs can only be used if the
       <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> is running under the root account.

       <I>Qrsh</I> is similar to <I>qlogin</I> in that it submits an interactive job to the
       queuing system.  It uses the current terminal for user I/O.  Usually,
       <I>qrsh</I> establishes a <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/rsh.html">rsh(1)</A></B> connection with the remote host. If no
       command is given to <I>qrsh</I>, an <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/rlogin.html">rlogin(1)</A></B> session is established.  The
       server-side commands used can be configured with the <B>rsh_daemon</B> and
       <B>rlogin_daemon</B> parameters in the global and local configuration settings
       of <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_conf.html">sge_conf(5)</A></B>.  An Grid Engine <I>rshd</I> or <I>rlogind</I> is used if the
       parameters are not set. If the parameters are set, they should be set
       to something like /usr/sbin/in.rshd or /usr/sbin/in.rlogind.  On the
       client-side, the <B>rsh_command</B> and <B>rlogin_command</B> parameters can be set
       in the global and local configuration settings of <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_conf.html">sge_conf(5)</A></B>.  If they
       are not set, special Grid Engine <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/rsh.html">rsh(1)</A></B> and <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/rlogin.html">rlogin(1)</A></B> binaries
       delivered with Grid Engine are used.  Use the cluster configuration
       parameters to integrate mechanisms like <I>ssh</I> or the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/rsh.html">rsh(1)</A></B> and <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/rlogin.html">rlogin(1)</A></B>
       facilities supplied with the operating system.

       <I>Qrsh</I> jobs can only run in INTERACTIVE queues unless the option <B>-now</B> <B>no</B>
       is used (see below).  They can also only be run if the <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> is
       running under the root account.

       <I>Qrsh</I> provides an additional useful feature for integrating with
       interactive tools providing a specific command shell. If the
       environment variable <B>QRSH_WRAPPER</B> is set when <I>qrsh</I> is invoked, the
       command interpreter pointed to by <B>QRSH_WRAPPER</B> will be executed to run
       <I>qrsh</I> commands instead of the users login shell or any shell specified
       in the <I>qrsh</I> command-line.  The options <B>-cwd</B>,  <B>-v</B>,  <B>-V</B>,  and <B>-display</B>
       only apply to batch jobs.

       <I>Qalter</I> can be used to change the attributes of pending jobs. For array
       jobs with a mix of running and pending tasks (see the <B>-t</B> option below),
       modification with <I>qalter</I> only affects the pending tasks.  <I>Qalter</I> can
       change most of the characteristics of a job (see the corresponding
       statements in the OPTIONS section below), including those which were
       defined as embedded flags in the script file (see above).  An option
       specified with <I>qalter</I> completely replaces any parameters previously
       specified for the job by that option, e.g. if the job has a resource
       requirement corresponding to <B>-l</B> <B>h_rt=3600,h_vmem=2G</B>, then after a
       <B>qalter</B> <B>-l</B> <B>h_rt=7200</B>, the resource requirement is simply <B>h_rt=7200</B>; it
       is not currently possible to override one or more value.

       Some submit options, such as the job script, cannot be changed with
       <I>qalter</I> <I>.</I>

       If a server JSV is defined, modifications are forbidden unless they are
       explicitly allowed by the <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_conf.html">sge_conf(5)</A></B> parameter <B>jsv_allowed_mod</B>.  (See
       also <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/jsv.html">jsv(1)</A></B>.)

       <I>Qresub</I> allows the user to create jobs as copies of existing pending or
       running jobs. The copied jobs will have exactly the same attributes as
       the ones from which they were copied, except with a new job ID and with
       a cleared hold state. The only modification to the copied jobs
       supported by <I>qresub</I> is assignment of a new hold state with the <B>-h</B>
       option. This option can be used to first copy a job and then change its
       attributes via <I>qalter</I>.

       Only a manager can use <I>qresub</I> on jobs submitted by another user.
       Regular users can only use <I>qresub</I> on their own jobs.

       For <I>qsub</I>, <I>qsh</I>, <I>qrsh</I>, and <I>qlogin</I> the administrator and the user may
       define default request files (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_request.html">sge_request(5)</A></B>) which can contain any
       of the options described below.  If an option in a default request file
       is understood by <I>qsub</I> and <I>qlogin</I> but not by <I>qsh</I> the option is silently
       ignored if <I>qsh</I> is invoked. Thus you can maintain shared default request
       files for both <I>qsub</I> and <I>qsh</I>.

       A cluster wide default request file may be placed under
       $SGE_ROOT/$SGE_CELL/common/sge_request.  User private default request
       files are processed under the locations $HOME/.sge_request and
       $cwd/.sge_request. The working directory local default request file has
       the highest precedence, then the home directory file and then the
       cluster global file.  The option arguments, the embedded script flags
       and the options in the default request files are processed in the
       following order:

              left to right in the script line,
              left to right in the default request files,
              from top to bottom of the script file (<I>qsub</I> only),
              from top to bottom of default request files,
              from left to right of the command line.

       In other words, the command line can be used to override the embedded
       flags and the default request settings.  The embedded flags, however,
       will override the default settings.

       <B>Note</B>, that the <I>-clear</I> option can be used to discard any previous
       settings at any time in a default request file, in the embedded script
       flags, or in a command-line option. It is, however, not available with
       <I>qalter</I>.

       The options described below can be requested either hard or soft.  By
       default, all requests are considered hard until the <B>-soft</B> option (see
       below) is encountered. The hard/soft status remains in effect until its
       counterpart is encountered again.  If all the hard requests for a job
       cannot be met, the job will not be scheduled.  Jobs which cannot be run
       at the present time remain spooled.

<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       <B>-@</B> <B>optionfile</B>
              Forces <I>qsub</I>, <I>qrsh</I>, <I>qsh</I>, or <I>qlogin</I> to use the options contained
              in <B>optionfile</B>. The indicated file may contain all valid options.
              Comment lines must start with a "#" sign.

       <B>-a</B> <B>date_time</B>
              Available for <I>qsub</I> and <I>qalter</I> only.

              Defines or redefines the time and date at which a job is
              eligible for execution. <B>Date_time</B> conforms to
              [[CC]]YY]MMDDhhmm[.SS], for the details, please see <B>Date_time</B>
              in: <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/sge_types.html">sge_types(1)</A></B>.

              If this option is used with <I>qsub</I> or if a corresponding value is
              specified in <I>qmon</I> then a parameter named <B>a</B> and the value in the
              format CCYYMMDDhhmm.SS will be passed to the defined JSV
              instances.  (See <B>-jsv</B> option below or find more information
              concerning JSV in <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/jsv.html">jsv(1)</A></B>.)

       <B>-ac</B> <B>variable[=value],...</B>
              Available for <I>qsub</I>, <I>qsh</I>, <I>qrsh</I>, <I>qlogin</I> and <I>qalter</I> only.

              Adds the given name/value pair(s) to the job's context. <B>Value</B>
              may be omitted. Grid Engine appends the given argument to the
              list of context variables for the job.  Multiple <B>-ac</B>, <B>-dc</B>, and
              <B>-sc</B> options may be given.  The order is important here.

              The outcome of the evaluation of all <B>-ac</B>, <B>-dc</B>, and <B>-sc</B> options
              or corresponding values in <I>qmon</I> is passed to defined JSV
              instances as parameter with the name <B>ac</B>.  (See <B>-jsv</B> option below
              or find more information concerning JSV in <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/jsv.html">jsv(1)</A></B>.)  <I>QALTER</I>
              allows changing this option even while the job executes.

       <B>-ar</B> <B>ar_id</B>
              Available for <I>qsub</I>, <I>qalter</I>, <I>qrsh</I>, <I>qsh</I>, or <I>qlogin</I> only.

              Assigns the submitted job to be a part of an existing Advance
              Reservation.  The complete list of existing Advance Reservations
              can be obtained using the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qrstat.html">qrstat(1)</A></B> command.

              Note that the <B>-ar</B> option adds implicitly the <B>-w</B> <B>e</B> option if not
              otherwise requested.

              <I>Qalter</I> allows changing this option even while the job executes.
              The modified parameter will only be in effect after a restart or
              migration of the job however.

              If this option or a corresponding value in <I>qmon</I> is specified
              then this value will be passed to defined JSV instances as
              parameter with the name <B>ar</B>.  (See <B>-jsv</B> option below or find more
              information concerning JSV in <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/jsv.html">jsv(1)</A></B>.)

       <B>-A</B> <B>account_string</B>
              Available for <I>qsub</I>, <I>qsh</I>, <I>qrsh</I>, <I>qlogin</I> and <I>qalter</I> only.

              Identifies the account to which the resource consumption of the
              job should be charged. The <B>account_string</B> should conform to the
              <B>name</B> definition in M sge_types 1 .  In the absence of this
              parameter Grid Engine will place the default account string
              "sge" in the accounting record of the job.

              <I>Qalter</I> allows changing this option even while the job executes.

              If this option or a corresponding value in <I>qmon</I> is specified
              then this value will be passed to defined JSV instances as
              parameter with the name <B>A</B>.  (See <B>-jsv</B> option below or find more
              information concerning JSV in <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/jsv.html">jsv(1)</A></B>.)

       <B>-b</B> <B>y[es]|n[o]</B>
              Available for <I>qsub</I>, <I>qrsh</I> only. <I>Qalter</I> does not allow changing
              this option. This option cannot be embedded in the script file
              itself.

              Gives the user the possibility to indicate explicitly whether
              <B>command</B> should be treated as binary or script. If the value of
              <B>-b</B> is 'y', then <B>command</B>  may be a binary or script.  The <B>command</B>
              might not be accessible from the submission host.  Nothing
              except the path of the <B>command</B> will be transferred from the
              submission host to the execution host. Path aliasing will be
              applied to the path of <B>command</B> before <B>command</B> will be executed.

              If the value of <B>-b</B> is 'n' then <B>command</B> needs to be a script and
              it will be handled as script. The script file has to be
              accessible by the submission host. It will be transferred to the
              execution host. <I>qsub</I>/<I>qrsh</I> will search directive prefixes within
              script.

              <I>qsub</I> will implicitly use <B>-b</B> <B>n</B> whereas <I>qrsh</I> will apply the <B>-b</B> <B>y</B>
              option if nothing else is specified.

              The value specified with this option or the corresponding value
              specified in <I>qmon</I> will only be passed to defined JSV instances
              if the value is <I>yes</I>.  The name of the parameter will be <B>b</B>. The
              value will be <B>y</B> also when then long form <B>yes</B> was specified
              during submission.  (See <B>-jsv</B> option below or find more
              information concerning JSV in <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/jsv.html">jsv(1)</A></B>.)

              Please note that submission of <B>command</B> as a script (<B>-b</B> <B>n</B>) can
              have a significant performance impact, especially for short
              running jobs and big job scripts.  Script submission adds a
              number of operations to the submission process: The job script
              needs to be
              - parsed at client side (for special comments)
              - transferred from submit client to qmaster
              - spooled in qmaster
              - transferred to execd at job execution
              - spooled in execd
              - removed from spooling both in execd and qmaster once the job is done
              If job scripts are available on the execution nodes, e.g. via
              NFS, binary submission can be the better choice.

       <B>-binding</B> <B>[</B> <B>binding_instance</B> <B>]</B> <B>binding_strategy</B>
              A job can request a specific processor core binding (processor
              affinity) with this parameter. This request is neither a hard
              nor a soft request, it is a hint for the execution host to do
              this if possible.  Please note that the requested binding
              strategy is not used for resource  selection  within  Grid
              Engine.  As a result an execution host might be selected where
              Grid Engine does not even know the hardware topology and
              therefore is not able to apply the requested binding.

              To make Grid Engine select hardware on which the binding can be
              applied, please use the <B>-l</B> switch in combination with the
              complex attribute <B>m_topology</B>.

              <B>binding_instance</B> is an optional parameter. It might either be
              <B>env</B>, <B>pe</B> or <B>set</B> depending on which instance should accomplish the
              job to core binding. If the value for <B>binding_instance</B> is not
              specified then <B>set</B> will be used.

              <B>env</B> means that the environment variable <B>SGE_BINDING</B> will be
              exported to the job environment of the job. This variable
              contains the selected operating system internal processor
              numbers.  In presence of SMT or CMT it may contain more than the
              number of cores selected, because each core could be represented
              by multiple processor identifiers.  The processor numbers are
              space-separated.

              <B>pe</B> means that the information about the selected cores appears
              in the fourth column of the <B>pe_hostfile</B>. Here the logical core
              and socket numbers are printed (they start at 0 and have no
              holes) in colon-separated pairs (e.g. "0,0:1,0", which means
              core 0 on socket 0 and core 0 on socket 1).  For more
              information about the $pe_hostfile check <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_pe.html">sge_pe(5)</A></B>.

              <B>set</B> (the default if nothing else is specified) means that the
              binding strategy is applied by Grid Engine.  Each shepherd (on
              the master host, or those connected to with qrsh -inherit) is
              bound to the relevant cores.  The binding is inherited by the
              task that is started, so that processes or threads it spawns are
              confined to those cores, but it is up to the task to make any
              more specific bindings of its sub-tasks within the set of bound
              cores it inherits.  How Grid Engine does this depends on the
              underlying hardware architecture of the execution host where the
              submitted job will be started.

              On Solaris 10 hosts a processor set will be created where the
              job can run exclusively.  Because of operating system
              limitations at least one core must remain unbound. This resource
              could, of course, be used by an unbound job.

              On Linux hosts a processor affinity mask will be set to restrict
              the job to run exclusively on the selected cores.  The operating
              system allows other unbound processes to use these cores.
              Please note that the binding requires a Linux kernel version of
              2.6.16 or greater. It might be possible to use a lower version
              number, but in that case additional kernel patches have to be
              applied. The <B>loadcheck</B> tool in the utilbin directory can be used
              to check the host's capabilities.  You can also use <B>-sep</B> in
              combination with <B>-cb</B> of <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/qconf.html">qconf(5)</A></B> to find whether Grid Engine is
              able to recognize the hardware topology.

              Possible values for <B>binding_strategy</B> are as follows:

                  linear:&lt;amount&gt;[:&lt;socket&gt;,&lt;core&gt;]
                  striding:&lt;amount&gt;:&lt;n&gt;[:&lt;socket&gt;,&lt;core&gt;]
                  explicit:[&lt;socket&gt;,&lt;core&gt;;...]&lt;socket&gt;,&lt;core&gt;

              For the binding strategies "linear" and "striding" there is an
              optional socket and core pair attached. These denote the
              mandatory starting point for the first core to bind on.

              <B>linear</B> means that Grid Engine tries to bind the job on <B>amount</B>
              successive cores. If <B>socket</B> and <B>core</B> are omitted then Grid
              Engine first allocates successive cores on the first empty
              socket found.  Empty means that there are no jobs bound to the
              socket by Grid Engine.  If this is not  possible, or is not
              sufficient, Grid Engine tries to find (further) cores on the
              socket with the most unbound cores, and so on.  If the number of
              allocated cores is lower than requested cores, no binding is
              done for the job. If <B>socket</B> and <B>core</B> are specified, then Grid
              Engine tries to find empty cores with this starting point. If
              this is not possible then binding is not done on the host
              concerned.

              <B>striding</B> means that Grid Engine tries to find cores with a
              certain offset.  It will select <B>amount</B> of empty cores with an
              offset of <B>n</B>-1 cores in between. Start point for the search
              algorithm is socket 0 core 0. As soon as <B>amount</B> cores are found
              they will be used to do the job binding.  If there are not
              enough empty cores, or if correct offset cannot be achieved,
              then no binding will be done on the host concerned.

              <B>explicit</B> binds the specified sockets and cores that are
              mentioned in the provided socket/core list. Each socket/core
              pair has to be specified only once. If a socket/core pair is
              already in use by a different job, the whole binding request
              will be ignored.

              Note that a binding like <B>pe</B> <B>linear</B>...  is only useful if the job
              has exclusive access to its multiple compute nodes, they all
              have the same topology, and the PE has a fixed allocation rule
              (<B>allocation_rule</B> <I>n</I>).  (The pe_hostfile content is created on the
              job's master host, with the same &lt;socket,core&gt; specification for
              each.)  This method can't be used for job isolation.  Similarly,
              <B>set</B> requires a fixed allocation per host for distributed
              parallel jobs.

              <B>Qalter</B> allows changing this option even while the job executes.
              The modified parameter will only be in effect after a restart or
              migration of the job, however.

              If this option, or a corresponding value in qmon, is specified
              then these values will be passed to defined JSV instances as
              parameters with the names <B>binding_strategy</B>, <B>binding_type</B>,
              <B>binding_amount</B>, <B>binding_step</B>, <B>binding_socket</B>, <B>binding_core</B>,
              <B>binding_exp_n</B>, <B>binding_exp_socket&lt;id&gt;</B>, <B>binding_exp_core&lt;id&gt;</B>.

              Please note that the length of the socket/core value list of the
              explicit binding is reported as <B>binding_exp_n</B>. <B>&lt;id&gt;</B> will be
              replaced by the position of the socket/core pair within the
              explicit list (0 &lt;= <B>id</B> &lt; <B>binding_exp_n</B>).  The first socket/core
              pair of the explicit binding will be reported with the parameter
              names <B>binding_exp_socket0</B> and binding_exp_core0.

              Values that do not apply for the specified binding will not be
              reported to JSV.  E.g. <B>binding_step</B> will only be reported for
              the striding binding and all <B>binding_exp_*</B> values will passed to
              JSV if explicit binding was specified.  (See <B>-jsv</B> option below
              or find more information concerning JSV in <I>jsv1</I>(.))

       <B>-c</B> <B>occasion_specifier</B>
              Available for <I>qsub</I> and <I>qalter</I> only.

              Defines or redefines whether the job should be checkpointed, and
              if so, under what circumstances. The specification of the
              checkpointing occasions with this option overwrites the
              definitions of the <I>when</I> parameter in the checkpointing
              environment (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/checkpoint.html">checkpoint(5)</A></B>) referenced by the <I>qsub</I> <I>-ckpt</I>
              switch.  Possible values for <B>occasion_specifier</B> are

              n           no checkpoint is performed.
              s           checkpoint when batch server is shut down.
              m           checkpoint at minimum CPU interval.
              x           checkpoint when job gets suspended.
              &lt;interval&gt;  checkpoint in the specified time interval.

              The minimum CPU interval is defined in the queue configuration
              (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html">queue_conf(5)</A></B> for details).  &lt;interval&gt; has to be specified
              in the format hh:mm:ss.  The maximum of &lt;interval&gt; and the
              queue's minimum CPU interval is used if &lt;interval&gt; is specified.
              This is done to ensure that a machine is not overloaded by
              checkpoints being generated too frequently.

              The value specified with this option or the corresponding value
              specified in <I>qmon</I> will be passed to defined JSV instances.  The
              &lt;interval&gt; will be available as parameter with the name
              <B>c_interval</B>.  The character sequence specified will be available
              as parameter with the name <B>c_occasion</B>. Please note that if you
              change <B>c_occasion</B> via JSV then the last setting of <B>c_interval</B>
              will be overwritten and vice versa.  (See <B>-jsv</B> option below or
              find more information concerning JSV in <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/jsv.html">jsv(1)</A></B>.)


       <B>-ckpt</B> <B>ckpt_name</B>
              Available for <I>qsub</I> and <I>qalter</I> only.

              Selects the checkpointing environment (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/checkpoint.html">checkpoint(5)</A></B>) to be
              used for checkpointing the job. Also declares the job to be a
              checkpointing job.

              If this option or a corresponding value in <I>qmon</I> is specified
              then this value will be passed to defined JSV instances as
              parameter with the name <B>ckpt</B>.  (See <B>-jsv</B> option below or find
              more information concerning JSV in <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/jsv.html">jsv(1)</A></B>.)

       <B>-clear</B> Available for <I>qsub</I>, <I>qsh</I>, <I>qrsh</I>, and <I>qlogin</I> only.

              Causes all elements of the job to be reset to the initial
              default status prior to applying any modifications (if any)
              appearing in this specific command.

       <B>-cwd</B>   Available for <I>qsub</I>, <I>qsh</I>, <I>qrsh</I> and <I>qalter</I> only.

              Execute the job from the current working directory.  This switch
              will activate Grid Engine's path aliasing facility, if the
              corresponding configuration files are present (see
              <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_aliases.html">sge_aliases(5)</A></B>).

              In the case of <I>qalter</I>, the previous definition of the current
              working directory will be overwritten if <I>qalter</I> is executed from
              a different directory than the preceding <I>qsub</I> or <I>qalter</I>.

              <I>Qalter</I> allows changing this option even while the job executes.
              The modified parameter will only be in effect after a restart or
              migration of the job, however.

              If this option or a corresponding value in <I>qmon</I> is specified
              then this value will be passed to defined JSV instances as
              parameter with the name <B>cwd</B>. The value of this parameter will be
              the absolute path to the current working directory. JSV scripts
              can remove the path from jobs during the verification process by
              setting the value of this parameter to an empty string. As a
              result the job behaves as if <B>-cwd</B> was not specified during job
              submission.  (See <B>-jsv</B> option below or find more information
              concerning JSV in <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/jsv.html">jsv(1)</A></B>.)


       <B>-C</B> <B>prefix_string</B>
              Available for <I>qsub</I> and <I>qrsh</I> with script submission (<B>-b</B> <B>n</B>).

              <I>Prefix</I><B>_</B><I>string</I> defines the prefix that declares a directive in
              the job's command. The prefix is not a job attribute, but
              affects the behavior of <I>qsub</I> and <I>qrsh</I>. If <B>prefix</B> is a null
              string, the command will not be scanned for embedded directives.
              The directive prefix consists of two ASCII characters which,
              when appearing in the first two bytes of a script line, indicate
              that what follows is an Grid Engine command.  The default is
              "#$".
              The user should be aware that changing the first delimiting
              character can produce unforeseen side effects. If the script
              file contains anything other than a "#" character in the first
              byte position of the line, the shell processor for the job will
              reject the line and may exit the job prematurely.
              If the -C option is present in the script file, it is ignored.

       <B>-dc</B> <B>variable,...</B>
              Available for <I>qsub</I>, <I>qsh</I>, <I>qrsh</I>, <I>qlogin</I> and <I>qalter</I> only.

              Removes the given variable(s) from the job's context.  Multiple
              <B>-ac</B>, <B>-dc</B>, and <B>-sc</B> options may be given.  The order is important.

              <I>Qalter</I> allows changing this option even while the job executes.

              The outcome of the evaluation of all <B>-ac</B>, <B>-dc</B>, and <B>-sc</B> options
              or corresponding values in <I>qmon</I> is passed to defined JSV
              instances as parameter with the name <B>ac</B>.  (See <B>-jsv</B> option below
              or find more information concerning JSV in <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/jsv.html">jsv(1)</A></B>.)

       <B>-display</B> <B>display_specifier</B>
              Available for <I>qsh</I> and <I>qrsh</I>.

              Directs <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/xterm.html">xterm(1)</A></B> to use <B>display_specifier</B> in order to contact
              the X server.  The <B>display_specifier</B> has to contain the hostname
              part of the display name (e.g. myhost:1).  Local display names
              (e.g. :0) cannot be used in grid environments.  Values set with
              the <B>-display</B> option overwrite settings from the submission
              environment and from <B>-v</B> command line options.

              If this option or a corresponding value in <I>qmon</I> is specified
              then this value will be passed to defined JSV instances as
              parameter with the name <B>display</B>. This value will also be
              available in the job environment which might optionally be
              passed to JSV scripts. The variable name will be <B>DISPLAY</B>.  (See
              <B>-jsv</B> option below or find more information concerning JSV in
              <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/jsv.html">jsv(1)</A></B>.)

       <B>-dl</B> <B>date_time</B>
              Available for <I>qsub</I>, <I>qsh</I>, <I>qrsh</I>, <I>qlogin</I> and <I>qalter</I> only.

              Specifies the deadline initiation time in [[CC]YY]MMDDhhmm[.SS]
              format (see <B>-a</B> option above). The deadline initiation time is
              the time at which a deadline job has to reach top priority to be
              able to complete within a given deadline. Before the deadline
              initiation time the priority of a deadline job will be raised
              steadily until it reaches the maximum as configured by the Grid
              Engine administrator.

              This option is applicable only for users allowed to submit
              deadline jobs.

              If this option or a corresponding value in <I>qmon</I> is specified
              then this value will be passed to defined JSV instances as
              parameter with the name <B>dl</B>. The format for the date_time value
              is CCYYMMDDhhmm.SS.  (See <B>-jsv</B> option below or find more
              information concerning JSV in <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/jsv.html">jsv(1)</A></B>.)


       <B>-e</B> <B>[[hostname]:]path,...</B>
              Available for <I>qsub</I>, <I>qsh</I>, <I>qrsh</I>, <I>qlogin</I> and <I>qalter</I> only.

              Defines or redefines the path used for the standard error stream
              of the job. For <I>qsh</I>, <I>qrsh</I> and <I>qlogin</I> only the standard error
              stream of prolog and epilog is redirected.  If the <B>path</B>
              constitutes an absolute path name, the error-path attribute of
              the job is set to <B>path</B>, including the <B>hostname</B>. If the path name
              is relative, Grid Engine expands <B>path</B> either with the current
              working directory path (if the <B>-cwd</B> switch (see above) is also
              specified) or with the home directory path. If <B>hostname</B> is
              present, the standard error stream will be placed in the
              corresponding location only if the job runs on the specified
              host. If the path contains a ":" without a <B>hostname</B>, a leading
              ":" has to be specified.

              By default the file name for interactive jobs is <I>/dev/null</I>. For
              batch jobs the default file name has the form <I>job</I><B>_</B><I>name.</I>e<I>job</I><B>_</B><I>id</I>
              and <I>job</I><B>_</B><I>name.</I>e<I>job</I><B>_</B><I>id</I>.<B>task_id</B> for array job tasks (see <B>-t</B> option
              below).

              If <B>path</B> is a directory, the standard error stream of the job
              will be put in this directory under the default file name.  If
              the pathname contains certain pseudo environment variables,
              their value will be expanded at runtime of the job and will be
              used to constitute the standard error stream path name. The
              following pseudo environment variables are supported currently:

              $HOME       home directory on execution machine
              $USER       user ID of job owner
              $JOB_ID     current job ID
              $JOB_NAME   current job name (see <B>-N</B> option)
              $HOSTNAME   name of the execution host
              $TASK_ID    array job task index number

              Alternatively to $HOME the tilde sign "~" can be used as common
              in <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/csh.html">csh(1)</A></B> or <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/ksh.html">ksh(1)</A></B>.  Note, that the "~" sign also works in
              combination with user names, so that "~&lt;user&gt;" expands to the
              home directory of &lt;user&gt;. Using another user ID than that of the
              job owner requires corresponding permissions, of course.

              <I>Qalter</I> allows changing this option even while the job executes.
              The modified parameter will only be in effect after a restart or
              migration of the job, however.

              If this option or a corresponding value in <I>qmon</I> is specified
              then this value will be passed to defined JSV instances as
              parameter with the name <B>e</B>.  (See <B>-jsv</B> option below or find more
              information concerning JSV in <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/jsv.html">jsv(1)</A></B>.)

       <B>-hard</B>  Available for <I>qsub</I>, <I>qsh</I>, <I>qrsh</I>, <I>qlogin</I> and <I>qalter</I> only.

              Signifies that all <B>-q</B> and <B>-l</B> resource requirements following in
              the command line will be hard requirements and must be satisfied
              in full before a job can be scheduled.
              As Grid Engine scans the command line and script file for Grid
              Engine options and parameters it builds a list of resources
              required by a job. All such resource requests are considered as
              absolutely essential for the job to commence. If the <B>-soft</B>
              option (see below) is encountered during the scan then all
              following resources are designated as "soft requirements" for
              execution, or "nice-to-have, but not essential". If the <B>-hard</B>
              flag is encountered at a later stage of the scan, all resource
              requests following it once again become "essential". The <B>-hard</B>
              and <B>-soft</B> options in effect act as "toggles" during the scan.

              If this option or a corresponding value in <I>qmon</I> is specified
              then the corresponding <B>-q</B> and <B>-l</B> resource requirements will be
              passed to defined JSV instances as parameter with the names
              <B>q_hard</B> and <B>l_hard</B>. Find for information in the sections
              describing <B>-q</B> and <B>-l</B>.  (See <B>-jsv</B> option below or find more
              information concerning JSV in <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/jsv.html">jsv(1)</A></B>.)

       <B>-h</B> <B>|</B> <B>-h</B> <B>{u|s|o|n|U|O|S}...</B>
              Available for <I>qsub</I> (only <B>-h</B>), <I>qrsh</I>, <I>qalter</I> and <I>qresub</I> (hold
              state is removed when not set explicitly).

              List of holds to place on a job, a task or some tasks of a job.

              `u'  denotes a user hold.
              `s'  denotes a system hold.
              `o'  denotes a operator hold.
              `n'  denotes no hold (requires manager privileges).

              As long as any hold other than `n' is assigned to the job the
              job is not eligible for execution. Holds can be released via
              <I>qalter</I> and <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qrls.html">qrls(1)</A></B>.  In case of <I>qalter</I> this is supported by the
              following additional option specifiers for the <B>-h</B> switch:

              `U'  removes a user hold.
              `S'  removes a system hold.
              `O'  removes a operator hold.

              Grid Engine managers can assign and remove all hold types, Grid
              Engine operators can assign and remove user and operator holds,
              and users can only assign or remove user holds.

              In the case of <I>qsub</I> only user holds can be placed on a job and
              thus only the first form of the option with the <B>-h</B> switch alone
              is allowed.  As opposed to this, <I>qalter</I> requires the second form
              described above.

              An alternate means to assign hold is provided by the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qhold.html">qhold(1)</A></B>
              facility.

              If the job is a array job (see the <B>-t</B> option below), all tasks
              specified via <B>-t</B> are affected by the <B>-h</B> operation
              simultaneously.

              <I>Qalter</I> allows changing this option even while the job executes.
              The modified parameter will only be in effect after a restart or
              migration of the job, however.

              If this option is specified with <I>qsub</I> or during the submission
              of a job in <I>qmon</I> then the parameter <B>h</B> with the value <B>u</B> will be
              passed to the defined JSV instances indicating that the job will
              be in user hold after the submission finishes.  (See <B>-jsv</B> option
              below or find more information concerning JSV in <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/jsv.html">jsv(1)</A></B>.)

       <B>-help</B>  Prints  a listing of all options.

       <B>-hold_jid</B> <B>wc_job_list</B>
              Available for <I>qsub</I>, <I>qrsh</I>, and <I>qalter</I> only. See <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/sge_types.html">sge_types(1)</A></B>.
              for <B>wc_job_list</B> definition.

              Defines or redefines the job dependency list of the submitted
              job. A reference by job name or pattern is only accepted if the
              referenced job is owned by the same user as the referring job.
              The submitted job is not eligible for execution unless all jobs
              referenced in the comma-separated job id and/or job name list
              have completed.  If any of the referenced jobs exits with exit
              code 100, the submitted job will remain ineligible for
              execution.

              With the help of job names or regular pattern one can specify a
              job dependency on multiple jobs satisfying the regular pattern
              or on all jobs with the requested name. The name dependencies
              are resolved at submit time and can only be changed via qalter.
              New jobs or name changes of other jobs will not be taken into
              account.  To remove a job dependency list with <I>qalter</I> <I>,</I> use a
              null <B>wc_job_list</B>, i.e. use
                 <B>qalter</B> <B>-hold_jid</B> <B>''</B> <B>...</B>

              <I>Qalter</I> allows changing this option even while the job executes.
              The modified parameter will only be in effect after a restart or
              migration of the job, however.

              If this option or a corresponding value in <I>qmon</I> is specified
              then this value will be passed to defined JSV instances as
              parameter with the name <B>hold_jid</B>.  (See <B>-jsv</B> option below or
              find more information concerning JSV in <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/jsv.html">jsv(1)</A></B>.)

       <B>-hold_jid_ad</B> <B>wc_job_list</B>
              Available for <I>qsub</I>, <I>qrsh</I>, and <I>qalter</I> only. See <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/sge_types.html">sge_types(1)</A></B>.
              for <B>wc_job_list</B> definition.

              Defines or redefines the job array dependency list of the
              submitted job. A reference by job name or pattern is only
              accepted if the referenced job is owned by the same user as the
              referring job. Each sub-task of the submitted job is not
              eligible for execution unless the corresponding sub-tasks of all
              jobs referenced in the comma-separated job id and/or job name
              list have completed.  If any array task of the referenced jobs
              exits with exit code 100, the dependent tasks of the submitted
              job will remain ineligible for execution.

              With the help of job names or regular pattern one can specify a
              job dependency on multiple jobs satisfying the regular pattern
              or on all jobs with the requested name. The name dependencies
              are resolved at submit time and can only be changed via qalter.
              New jobs or name changes of other jobs will not be taken into
              account.

              If either the submitted job or any job in wc_job_list are not
              array jobs with the same range of sub-tasks (see <B>-t</B> option
              below), the request list will be rejected and the job create or
              modify operation will error.

              <I>qalter</I> allows changing this option even while the job executes.
              The modified parameter will only be in effect after a restart or
              migration of the job, however.

              If this option or a corresponding value in <I>qmon</I> is specified
              then this value will be passed to defined JSV instances as
              parameter with the name <B>hold_jid_ad</B>.  (See <B>-jsv</B> option below or
              find more information concerning JSV in <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/jsv.html">jsv(1)</A></B>.)

       <B>-i</B> <B>[[hostname]:]file,...</B>
              Available for <I>qsub</I>, and <I>qalter</I> only.

              Defines or redefines the file used for the standard input stream
              of the job. If the <I>file</I> constitutes an absolute filename, the
              input-path attribute of the job is set to <B>path</B>, including the
              <B>hostname</B>. If the path name is relative, Grid Engine expands <B>path</B>
              either with the current working directory path (if the <B>-cwd</B>
              switch (see above) is also specified) or with the home directory
              path. If <B>hostname</B> is present, the standard input stream will be
              placed in the corresponding location only if the job runs on the
              specified host. If the path contains a ":" without a <B>hostname</B>, a
              leading ":" has to be specified.

              By default /dev/null is the input stream for the job.

              It is possible to use certain pseudo variables, whose values
              will be expanded at runtime of the job and will be used to
              express the standard input stream as described in the <I>-e</I> option
              for the standard error stream.

              <I>Qalter</I> allows changing this option even while the job executes.
              The modified parameter will only be in effect after a restart or
              migration of the job, however.

              If this option or a corresponding value in <I>qmon</I> is specified
              then this value will be passed to defined JSV instances as
              parameter with the name <B>i</B>.  (See <B>-jsv</B> option below or find more
              information concerning JSV in <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/jsv.html">jsv(1)</A></B>.)

       <B>-inherit</B>
              Available only for <I>qrsh</I> and <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qmake.html">qmake(1)</A></B>.

              <I>qrsh</I> allows the user to start a task in an already scheduled
              parallel job.  The option <B>-inherit</B> tells <I>qrsh</I> to read a job id
              from the environment variable JOB_ID and start the specified
              command as a task in this job. Please note that in this case,
              the hostname of the host where the command will be executed must
              precede the command to execute; the syntax changes to

              <B>qrsh</B> <B>-inherit</B> [ <B>other</B> <B>options</B> ] <B>hostname</B> <B>command</B> [ <B>command_args</B>
              ]

              Note also, that in combination with <B>-inherit</B>, most other command
              line options will be ignored.  Only the options <B>-verbose</B>, <B>-v</B> and
              <B>-V</B> will be interpreted.  As a replacement to option <B>-cwd</B> please
              use <B>-v</B> <B>PWD</B>.

              Usually a task should have the same environment (including the
              current working directory) as the corresponding job, so
              specifying the option <B>-V</B> should be suitable for most
              applications.

              <I>Note:</I> If in your system the qmaster tcp port is not configured
              as a service, but rather via the environment variable
              SGE_QMASTER_PORT, make sure that this variable is set in the
              environment when calling <I>qrsh</I> or <I>qmake</I> with the <B>-inherit</B> option.
              If you call <I>qrsh</I> or <I>qmake</I> with the <B>-inherit</B> option from within a
              job script, export SGE_QMASTER_PORT with the option "-v
              SGE_QMASTER_PORT" either as a command argument or an embedded
              directive.

              This parameter is not available in the JSV context.  (See <B>-jsv</B>
              option below or find more information concerning JSV in <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/jsv.html">jsv(1)</A></B>.)


       <B>-j</B> <B>y[es]|n[o]</B>
              Available for <I>qsub</I>, <I>qsh</I>, <I>qrsh</I>, <I>qlogin</I> and <I>qalter</I> only.

              Specifies whether or not the standard error stream of the job is
              merged into the standard output stream.
              If both the <B>-j</B> <B>y</B> and the <B>-e</B> options are present, Grid Engine
              sets but ignores the error-path attribute.

              <I>Qalter</I> allows changing this option even while the job executes.
              The modified parameter will only be in effect after a restart or
              migration of the job, however.

              The value specified with this option or the corresponding value
              specified in <I>qmon</I> will only be passed to defined JSV instances
              if the value is <I>yes</I>.  The name of the parameter will be <B>j</B>. The
              value will be <B>y</B> also when then long form <B>yes</B> was specified
              during submission.  (See <B>-jsv</B> option below or find more
              information concerning JSV in <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/jsv.html">jsv(1)</A></B>.)

       <B>-js</B> <B>job_share</B>
              Available for <I>qsub</I>, <I>qsh</I>, <I>qrsh</I>, <I>qlogin</I> and <I>qalter</I> only.

              Defines or redefines the job share of the job relative to other
              jobs.  Job share is an unsigned integer value.  The default job
              share value for jobs is 0.

              The job share influences the Share Tree Policy and the
              Functional Policy. It has no effect on the Urgency and Override
              Policies (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/share_tree.html">share_tree(5)</A></B>, <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sched_conf.html">sched_conf(5)</A></B> and the <I>Grid</I> <I>Engine</I>
              <I>Installation</I> <I>and</I> <I>Administration</I> <I>Guide</I> for further information on
              the resource management policies supported by Grid Engine).

              In case of the Share Tree Policy, users can distribute the
              tickets to which they are currently entitled among their jobs
              using different shares assigned via <B>-js</B>. If all jobs have the
              same job share value, the tickets are distributed evenly.
              Otherwise, jobs receive tickets relative to the different job
              shares. Job shares are treated like an additional level in the
              share tree in the latter case.

              In connection with the Functional Policy, the job share can be
              used to weight jobs within the functional job category.  Tickets
              are distributed relative to any uneven job share distribution
              treated as a virtual share distribution level underneath the
              functional job category.

              If both the Share Tree and the Functional Policy are active, the
              job shares will have an effect in both policies, and the tickets
              independently derived in each of them are added to the total
              number of tickets for each job.

              If this option or a corresponding value in <I>qmon</I> is specified
              then this value will be passed to defined JSV instances as
              parameter with the name <B>js</B>.  (See <B>-jsv</B> option below or find more
              information concerning JSV in <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/jsv.html">jsv(1)</A></B>.)

       <B>-jsv</B> <B>jsv_url</B>
              Available for <I>qsub</I>, <I>qsh</I>, <I>qrsh</I> and <I>qlogin</I> only.

              Defines a client JSV instance which will be executed to verify
              the job specification before the job is sent to qmaster.

              In contrast to other options this switch will not be overwritten
              if it is also used in sge_request files. Instead all specified
              JSV instances will be executed to verify the job to be
              submitted.

              The JSV instance which is directly passed with the command line
              of a client is executed first to verify the job specification.
              After that the JSV instance which might have been defined in
              various sge_request files will be triggered to check the job.
              Find more details in man page <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/jsv.html">jsv(1)</A></B> and <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_request.html">sge_request(5)</A></B>.

              The syntax of the <B>jsv_url</B> is specified in <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/sge_types.html">sge_types(1)</A></B>.

       <B>-l</B> <B>resource=value</B>,...
              Available for <I>qsub</I>, <I>qsh</I>, <I>qrsh</I>, <I>qlogin</I> and <I>qalter</I> only.

              Launch the job in a Grid Engine queue meeting the given resource
              request list.  In case of <I>qalter</I> the previous definition is
              replaced by the specified one.

              <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/complex.html">complex(5)</A></B> describes how a list of available resources and their
              associated valid value specifiers can be obtained.

              There may be multiple <B>-l</B> switches in a single command. You may
              request multiple <B>-l</B> options to be soft or hard both in the same
              command line. In case of a serial job multiple <B>-l</B> switches
              refine the definition for the sought queue.

              <I>Qalter</I> allows changing the value of this option even while the
              job is running, but only if the initial list of resources does
              not contain a resource that is marked as consumable. However the
              modification will only be effective after a restart or migration
              of the job.

              If this option or a corresponding value in <I>qmon</I> is specified the
              these hard and soft resource requirements will be passed to
              defined JSV instances as parameter with the names <B>l_hard</B> and
              <B>l_soft</B>. If regular expressions will be used for resource
              requests, then these expressions will be passed as they are.
              Also shortcut names will not be expanded.  (See <B>-jsv</B> option
              above or find more information concerning JSV in <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/jsv.html">jsv(1)</A></B>.)

       <B>-m</B> <B>b|e|a|s|n,...</B>
              Available for <I>qsub</I>, <I>qsh</I>, <I>qrsh</I>, <I>qlogin</I> and <I>qalter</I> only.

              Defines or redefines under which circumstances mail is to be
              sent to the job owner or to the users defined with the <B>-M</B> option
              described below. The option arguments have the following
              meaning:

              `b'     Mail is sent at the beginning of the job.
              `e'     Mail is sent at the end of the job.
              `a'     Mail is sent when the job is aborted or
                      rescheduled.
              `s'     Mail is sent when the job is suspended.
              `n'     No mail is sent.

              Currently no mail is sent when a job is suspended.

              <I>Qalter</I> allows changing the b, e, and a option arguments even
              while the job executes. The modification of the b option
              argument will only be in effect after a restart or migration of
              the job, however.

              If this option or a corresponding value in <I>qmon</I> is specified
              then this value will be passed to defined JSV instances as
              parameter with the name <B>m</B>.  (See <B>-jsv</B> option above or find more

              Available for <I>qsub</I>, <I>qsh</I>, <I>qrsh</I>, <I>qlogin</I> and <I>qalter</I> only.

              Defines or redefines the list of users to which the server that
              executes the job has to send mail, if the server sends mail
              about the job.  Default is the job owner at the originating
              host.

              <I>Qalter</I> allows changing this option even while the job executes.

              If this option or a corresponding value in <I>qmon</I> is specified
              then this value will be passed to defined JSV instances as
              parameter with the name <B>M</B>.  (See <B>-jsv</B> option above or find more
              information concerning JSV in <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/jsv.html">jsv(1)</A></B>.)

       <B>-masterq</B> <B>wc_queue_list</B>
              Available for <I>qsub</I>, <I>qrsh</I>, <I>qsh</I>, <I>qlogin</I> and <I>qalter</I>.  Only
              meaningful for parallel jobs, i.e. together with the -pe option.

              Defines or redefines a list of cluster queues, queue domains and
              queue instances which may be used to become the so called <I>master</I>
              <I>queue</I> of this parallel job. A more detailed description of
              <I>wc</I><B>_</B><I>queue</I><B>_</B><I>list</I> can be found in <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/sge_types.html">sge_types(1)</A></B>.  The <I>master</I> <I>queue</I> is
              defined as the queue where the parallel job is started. The
              other queues to which the parallel job spawns tasks are called
              <I>slave</I> <I>queues</I>.  A parallel job only has one <I>master</I> <I>queue</I>.

              This parameter has all the properties of a resource request and
              will be merged with requirements derived from the <B>-l</B> option
              described above.

              <I>Qalter</I> allows changing this option even while the job executes.
              The modified parameter will only be in effect after a restart or
              migration of the job, however.

              If this option or a corresponding value in <I>qmon</I> is specified the
              this hard resource requirement will be passed to defined JSV
              instances as parameter with the name <B>masterq</B>.  (See <B>-jsv</B> option
              above or find more information concerning JSV in <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/jsv.html">jsv(1)</A></B>.)

       <B>-notify</B>
              Available for <I>qsub</I>, <I>qrsh</I> (with command) and <I>qalter</I> only.

              This flag, when set causes Grid Engine to send "warning" signals
              to a running job prior to sending the signals themselves. If a
              SIGSTOP is pending, the job will receive a SIGUSR1 several
              seconds before the SIGSTOP. If a SIGKILL is pending, the job
              will receive a SIGUSR2 several seconds before the SIGKILL.  This
              option provides the running job, before receiving the SIGSTOP or
              SIGKILL, a configured time interval to do e.g. cleanup
              operations.  The amount of time delay is controlled by the
              <B>notify</B> parameter in each queue configuration (see
              <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html">queue_conf(5)</A></B>).

              Note that the Linux operating system "misused" the user signals
              SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 in some early Posix thread implementations.
              You might not want to use the <B>-notify</B> option if you are running
              multi-threaded applications in your jobs under Linux,
              particularly on 2.0 or earlier kernels.

              <I>Qalter</I> allows changing this option even while the job executes.

              Only if this option is used the parameter named <B>notify</B> with the
              value <B>y</B> will be passed to defined JSV instances.  (See <B>-jsv</B>
              option above or find more information concerning JSV in <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/jsv.html">jsv(1)</A></B>.)

       <B>-now</B> <B>y[es]|n[o]</B>
              Available for <I>qsub</I>, <I>qsh</I>, <I>qlogin</I> and <I>qrsh</I>.

              <B>-now</B> <B>y</B> tries to start the job immediately or not at all. The
              command returns 0 on success, or 1 on failure (also if the job
              could not be scheduled immediately).  For array jobs submitted
              with the <B>-now</B> option, if all tasks cannot be immediately
              scheduled, no tasks are scheduled.

              Jobs submitted with <B>-now</B> <B>y</B> option, can ONLY run on INTERACTIVE
              queues.  <B>-now</B> <B>y</B> is default for <I>qsh</I>, <I>qlogin</I> and <I>qrsh</I>

              With the <B>-now</B> <B>n</B> option, the job will be put into the pending
              queue if it cannot be executed immediately. <B>-now</B> <B>n</B> is default
              for <I>qsub</I>.

       <B>-N</B> <B>name</B>
              Available for <I>qsub</I>, <I>qsh</I>, <I>qrsh</I>, <I>qlogin</I> and <I>qalter</I> only.

              The name of the job. The name should follow the "<B>name</B>"
              definition in <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/sge_types.html">sge_types(1)</A></B>.  Invalid job names will be denied at
              submit time.

              If the <B>-N</B> option is not present, Grid Engine assigns the name of
              the job script to the job after any directory pathname has been
              removed from the script-name. If the script is read from
              standard input, the job name defaults to STDIN.

              In the case of <I>qsh</I> or <I>qlogin</I> with the <B>-N</B> option is absent, the
              string `INTERACT' is assigned to the job.

              In the case of <I>qrsh</I> if the <B>-N</B> option is absent, the resulting
              job name is determined from the qrsh command line by using the
              argument string up to the first occurrence of a semicolon or
              whitespace and removing the directory pathname.

              <I>Qalter</I> allows changing this option even while the job executes.

              The value specified with this option or the corresponding value
              specified in <I>qmon</I> will be passed to defined JSV instances as
              parameter with the name <I>N</I>.  (See <B>-jsv</B> option above or find more
              information concerning JSV in <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/jsv.html">jsv(1)</A></B>.)

       <B>-noshell</B>
              Available only for <I>qrsh</I> with a command line.

              Do not start the command line given to <I>qrsh</I> in a user's login
              shell, i.e.  execute it without the wrapping shell.

              This option can be used to speed up execution as some overhead,
              like the shell startup and sourcing the shell resource files, is
              avoided.

              This option can only be used if no shell-specific command line
              parsing is required. If the command line contains shell syntax
              like environment variable substitution or (back) quoting, a
              shell must be started.  In this case, either do not use the
              <B>-noshell</B> option or include the shell call in the command line.

              Example:
              qrsh echo '$HOSTNAME'
              Alternative call with the <B>-noshell</B> option
              qrsh -noshell /bin/tcsh -f -c 'echo $HOSTNAME'

       <B>-nostdin</B>
              Available only for <I>qrsh</I>.

              Suppress the input stream STDIN - <I>qrsh</I> will pass the option <B>-n</B>
              to the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/rsh.html">rsh(1)</A></B> command. This is especially useful, if multiple
              tasks are executed in parallel using <I>qrsh</I>, e.g. in a <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/make.html">make(1)</A></B>
              process - it would be undefined, which process would get the
              input.

       <B>-o</B> <B>[[hostname]:]path,...</B>
              Available for <I>qsub</I>, <I>qsh</I>, <I>qrsh</I>, <I>qlogin</I> and <I>qalter</I> only.

              The path used for the standard output stream of the job. The
              <B>path</B> is handled as described in the <B>-e</B> option for the standard
              error stream.

              By default the file name for standard output has the form
              <I>job</I><B>_</B><I>name.</I>o<I>job</I><B>_</B><I>id</I> and <I>job</I><B>_</B><I>name.</I>o<I>job</I><B>_</B><I>id</I>.<B>task_id</B> for array job
              tasks (see <B>-t</B> option below).

              <I>Qalter</I> allows changing this option even while the job executes.
              The modified parameter will only be in effect after a restart or
              migration of the job, however.

              If this option or a corresponding value in <I>qmon</I> is specified
              then this value will be passed to defined JSV instances as
              parameter with the name <B>o</B>.  (See <B>-jsv</B> option above or find more
              information concerning JSV in <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/jsv.html">jsv(1)</A></B>.)

       <B>-ot</B> <B>override_tickets</B>
              Available for <I>qalter</I> only.

              Changes the number of override tickets for the specified job.
              Requires manager/operator privileges.

       <B>-P</B> <B>project_name</B>
              Available for <I>qsub</I>, <I>qsh</I>, <I>qrsh</I>, <I>qlogin</I> and <I>qalter</I> only.

              Specifies the project to which this job is assigned. The
              administrator needs to give permission to individual users to
              submit jobs to a specific project (see <B>-aprj</B> option to
              <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qconf.html">qconf(1)</A></B>).

              If this option or a corresponding value in <I>qmon</I> is specified
              then this value will be passed to defined JSV instances as
              parameter with the name <B>ot</B>.  (See <B>-jsv</B> option above or find more
              information concerning JSV in <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/jsv.html">jsv(1)</A></B>.)

       <B>-p</B> <B>priority</B>
              Available for <I>qsub</I>, <I>qsh</I>, <I>qrsh</I>, <I>qlogin</I> and <I>qalter</I> only.

              Defines or redefines the priority of the job relative to other
              jobs.  Priority is an integer in the range -1023 to 1024.  The
              default priority value for jobs is 0.

              Users may only decrease the priority of their jobs.  Grid Engine
              managers and administrators may also increase the priority
              associated with jobs. If a pending job has higher priority, it
              is earlier eligible for being dispatched by the Grid Engine
              scheduler.

              If this option or a corresponding value in <I>qmon</I> is specified and
              the priority is not 0 then this value will be passed to defined
              JSV instances as parameter with the name <B>p</B>.  (See <B>-jsv</B> option
              above or find more information concerning JSV in <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/jsv.html">jsv(1)</A></B>.)

       <B>-pe</B> <B>parallel_environment</B> <B>n[-[m]]|[-]m,...</B>
              Available for <I>qsub</I>, <I>qsh</I>, <I>qrsh</I>, <I>qlogin</I> and <I>qalter</I> only.

              Parallel programming environment (PE) to instantiate. For more
              detail about PEs, please see the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/sge_types.html">sge_types(1)</A></B>.

              <I>Qalter</I> allows changing this option even while the job executes.
              The modified parameter will only be in effect after a restart or
              migration of the job, however.

              If this option or a corresponding value in <I>qmon</I> is specified
              then the parameters <B>pe_name</B>, <B>pe_min</B> and <B>pe_max</B> will be passed to
              configured JSV instances where <B>pe_name</B> will be the name of the
              parallel environment and the values <B>pe_min</B> and <B>pe_max</B> represent
              the values n and m which have been provided with the <B>-pe</B> option.
              A missing specification of m will be expanded as value 9999999
              in JSV scripts and it represents the value infinity.  (See <B>-jsv</B>
              option above or find more information concerning JSV in <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/jsv.html">jsv(1)</A></B>.)

       <B>-pty</B> <B>y[es]|n[o]</B>
              Available for <I>qrsh</I>, <I>qsub</I> and <I>qlogin</I> only.

              -pty yes starts the job in a pseudo terminal (pty). If no pty is
              available, the job start fails.  -pty no starts the job without
              a pty.  By default, <I>qrsh</I> <I>without</I> <I>a</I> <I>command</I> and <I>qlogin</I> starts the
              job in a pty, and <I>qrsh</I> <I>or</I> <I>qsub</I> <I>with</I> <I>a</I> <I>command</I> starts the job
              without a pty.

              This parameter is not available in the JSV context.  (See <B>-jsv</B>
              option above or find more information concerning JSV in <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/jsv.html">jsv(1)</A></B>.)

       <B>-q</B> <B>wc_queue_list</B>
              Available for <I>qsub</I>, <I>qrsh</I>, <I>qsh</I>, <I>qlogin</I> and <I>qalter</I>.

              Defines or redefines a list of cluster queues, queue domains or
              queue instances which may be used to execute this job. Please
              find a description of <I>wc</I><B>_</B><I>queue</I><B>_</B><I>list</I> in <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/sge_types.html">sge_types(1)</A></B>.  This
              parameter has all the properties of a resource request and will
              be merged with requirements derived from the <B>-l</B> option described
              above.

              <I>Qalter</I> allows changing this option even while the job executes.
              The modified parameter will only be in effect after a restart or
              migration of the job, however.

              If this option or a corresponding value in <I>qmon</I> is specified
              then these hard and soft resource requirements will be passed to
              defined JSV instances as parameters with the names <B>q_hard</B> and
              <B>q_soft</B>. If regular expressions will be used for resource
              requests, then these expressions will be passed as they are.
              Also shortcut names will not be expanded.  (See <B>-jsv</B> option
              above or find more information concerning JSV in <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/jsv.html">jsv(1)</A></B>.)

       <B>-R</B> <B>y[es]|n[o]</B>
              Available for <I>qsub</I>, <I>qrsh</I>, <I>qsh</I>, <I>qlogin</I> and <I>qalter</I>.

              Indicates whether a reservation for this job should be done.
              Reservation is never done for immediate jobs, i.e. jobs
              submitted using the <B>-now</B> <B>yes</B> option.  Please note that
              regardless of the reservation request, job reservation might be
              disabled using max_reservation in <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sched_conf.html">sched_conf(5)</A></B> and might be
              limited only to a certain number of high priority jobs.

              By default jobs are submitted with the <B>-R</B> <B>n</B> option.

              The value specified with this option or the corresponding value
              specified in <I>qmon</I> will only be passed to defined JSV instances
              if the value is <I>yes</I>.  The name of the parameter will be <B>R</B>. The
              value will be <B>y</B> also when then long form <B>yes</B> was specified
              during submission.  (See <B>-jsv</B> option above or find more
              information concerning JSV in <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/jsv.html">jsv(1)</A></B>.)

       <B>-r</B> <B>y[es]|n[o]</B>
              Available for <I>qsub</I> and <I>qalter</I> only.

              Identifies the ability of a job to be rerun or not.  If the
              value of <B>-r</B> is 'yes', the job will be rerun if the job was
              aborted without leaving a consistent exit state.  (This is
              typically the case if the node on which the job is running
              crashes).  If <B>-r</B> is 'no', the job will not be rerun under any
              circumstances.
              Interactive jobs submitted with <I>qsh,</I> <I>qrsh</I> or <I>qlogin</I> are not
              rerunnable.

              <I>Qalter</I> allows changing this option even while the job executes.

              The value specified with this option or the corresponding value
              specified in <I>qmon</I> will only be passed to defined JSV instances
              if the value is <I>yes</I>.  The name of the parameter will be <B>r</B>. The
              value will be <B>y</B> also when then long form <B>yes</B> was specified
              during submission.  (See <B>-jsv</B> option above or find more
              information concerning JSV in <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/jsv.html">jsv(1)</A></B>.)

       <B>-sc</B> <B>variable[=value],...</B>
              Available for <I>qsub</I>, <I>qsh</I>, <I>qrsh</I>, <I>qlogin</I> and <I>qalter</I> only.

              Sets the given name/value pairs as the job's context. <B>Value</B> may
              be omitted. Grid Engine replaces the job's previously defined
              context with the one given as the argument.  Multiple <B>-ac</B>, <B>-dc</B>,
              and <B>-sc</B> options may be given.  The order is important.

              Contexts provide a way to dynamically attach and remove meta-
              information to and from a job. The context variables are <B>not</B>
              passed to the job's execution context in its environment.

              <I>Qalter</I> allows changing this option even while the job executes.

              The outcome of the evaluation of all <B>-ac</B>, <B>-dc</B>, and <B>-sc</B> options
              or corresponding values in <I>qmon</I> is passed to defined JSV
              instances as parameter with the name <B>ac</B>.  (See <B>-jsv</B> option above
              or find more information concerning JSV in <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/jsv.html">jsv(1)</A></B>.)

       <B>-shell</B> <B>y[es]|n[o]</B>
              Available only for <I>qsub</I>.

              <B>-shell</B> <B>n</B> causes qsub to execute the command line directly, as if
              by <B><A HREF="../htmlman2/exec.html">exec(2)</A></B>.  No command shell will be executed for the job.
              This option only applies when <B>-b</B> <B>y</B> is also used.  Without <B>-b</B> <B>y</B>,
              <B>-shell</B> <B>n</B> has no effect.

              This option can be used to speed up execution as some overhead,
              like the shell startup and sourcing the shell resource files is
              avoided.

              This option can only be used if no shell-specific command line
              parsing is required. If the command line contains shell syntax,
              like environment variable substitution or (back) quoting, a
              shell must be started.  In this case either do not use the
              <B>-shell</B> <B>n</B> option or execute the shell as the command line and
              pass the path to the executable as a parameter.

              If a job executed with the <B>-shell</B> <B>n</B> option fails due to a user
              error, such as an invalid path to the executable, the job will
              enter the error state.

              <B>-shell</B> <B>y</B> cancels the effect of a previous <B>-shell</B> <B>n</B>.  Otherwise,
              it has no effect.

              See <B>-b</B> and <B>-noshell</B> for more information.

              The value specified with this option or the corresponding value
              specified in <I>qmon</I> will only be passed to defined JSV instances
              if the value is <I>yes</I>.  The name of the parameter will be <B>shell</B>.
              The value will be <B>y</B> also when then long form <B>yes</B> was specified
              during submission.  (See <B>-jsv</B> option above or find more
              information concerning JSV in <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/jsv.html">jsv(1)</A></B>.)

       <B>-soft</B>  Available for <I>qsub</I>, <I>qsh</I>, <I>qrsh</I>, <I>qlogin</I> and <I>qalter</I> only.

              Signifies that all resource requirements following in the
              command line will be soft requirements and are to be filled on
              an "as available" basis.
              As Grid Engine scans the command line and script file for Grid
              Engine options and parameters, it builds a list of resources
              required by the job. All such resource requests are considered
              as absolutely essential for the job to commence. If the <B>-soft</B>
              option is encountered during the scan then all following
              resources are designated as "soft requirements" for execution,
              or "nice-to-have, but not essential". If the <B>-hard</B> flag (see
              above) is encountered at a later stage of the scan, all resource
              requests following it once again become "essential". The <B>-hard</B>
              and <B>-soft</B> options in effect act as "toggles" during the scan.

              If this option or a corresponding value in <I>qmon</I> is specified
              then the corresponding <B>-q</B> and <B>-l</B> resource requirements will be
              passed to defined JSV instances as parameter with the names
              <B>q_soft</B> and <B>l_soft</B>. Find for information in the sections
              describing <B>-q</B> and <B>-l</B>.  (See <B>-jsv</B> option above or find more
              information concerning JSV in <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/jsv.html">jsv(1)</A></B>.)

       <B>-sync</B> <B>y[es]|n[o]</B>
              Available for <I>qsub</I>.

              <B>-sync</B> <B>y</B> causes <I>qsub</I> to wait for the job to complete before
              exiting.  If the job completes successfully, <I>qsub's</I> exit code
              will be that of the completed job.  If the job fails to complete
              successfully, <I>qsub</I> will print out a error message indicating why
              the job failed and will have an exit code of 1.  If <I>qsub</I> is
              interrupted, e.g. with CTRL-C, before the job completes, the job
              will be canceled.
              With the <B>-sync</B> <B>n</B> option, <I>qsub</I> will exit with an exit code of 0
              as soon as the job is submitted successfully.  <B>-sync</B> <B>n</B> is
              default for <I>qsub</I>.
              If <B>-sync</B> <B>y</B> is used in conjunction with <B>-now</B> <B>y</B>, <I>qsub</I> will behave
              as though only <B>-now</B> <B>y</B> were given until the job has been
              successfully scheduled, after which time <I>qsub</I> will behave as
              though only <B>-sync</B> <B>y</B> were given.
              If <B>-sync</B> <B>y</B> is used in conjunction with <B>-t</B> <B>n[-m[:i]]</B>, <I>qsub</I> will
              wait for all the job's tasks to complete before exiting.  If all
              the job's tasks complete successfully, <I>qsub's</I> exit code will be
              that of the first completed job tasks with a non-zero exit code,
              or 0 if all job tasks exited with an exit code of 0.  If any of
              the job's tasks fail to complete successfully, <I>qsub</I> will print
              out an error message indicating why the job task(s) failed and
              will have an exit code of 1.  If <I>qsub</I> is interrupted, e.g. with
              CTRL-C, before the job completes, all of the job's tasks will be
              canceled.

              Information that this switch was specified during submission is
              not available in the JSV context.  (see <B>-jsv</B> option above or
              find more information concerning JSV in <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/jsv.html">jsv(1)</A></B>)

       <B>-S</B> <B>[[hostname]:]pathname,...</B>
              Available for <I>qsub</I>, <I>qsh</I> and <I>qalter</I>.

              Specifies the interpreting shell for the job. Only one <B>pathname</B>
              component without a <B>host</B> specifier is valid and only one path
              name for a given host is allowed. Shell paths with host
              assignments define the interpreting shell for the job if the
              host is the execution host. The shell path without host
              specification is used if the execution host matches none of the
              hosts in the list.

              Furthermore, the pathname can be constructed with pseudo
              environment variables as described for the <B>-e</B> option above.

              In the case of <I>qsh</I> the specified shell path is used to execute
              the corresponding command interpreter in the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/xterm.html">xterm(1)</A></B> (via its
              <I>-e</I> option) started on behalf of the interactive job.  <I>Qalter</I>
              allows changing this option even while the job executes. The
              modified parameter will only be in effect after a restart or
              migration of the job, however.

              If this option or a corresponding value in <I>qmon</I> is specified
              then this value will be passed to defined JSV instances as
              parameter with the name <B>S</B>.  (See <B>-jsv</B> option above or find more
              information concerning JSV in <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/jsv.html">jsv(1)</A></B>.)

       <B>-t</B> <B>n[-m[:s]]</B>
              Available for <I>qsub</I> and <I>qalter</I> only.

              Submits a so called <I>Array</I> <I>Job</I>, i.e. an array of identical tasks
              being differentiated only by an index number and being treated
              by Grid Engine almost like a series of jobs. The option argument
              to <B>-t</B> specifies the number of array job tasks and the index
              number which will be associated with the tasks. The index
              numbers will be exported to the job tasks via the environment
              variable <B>SGE_TASK_ID</B>. The option arguments n, m and s will be
              available through the environment variables <B>SGE_TASK_FIRST</B>,
              <B>SGE_TASK_LAST</B> and  <B>SGE_TASK_STEPSIZE</B>.

              The following restrictions apply to the values n and m:

                     1 &lt;= n &lt;= MIN(2^31-1, max_aj_tasks)
                     1 &lt;= m &lt;= MIN(2^31-1, max_aj_tasks)
                     n &lt;= m

              <I>max</I><B>_</B><I>aj</I><B>_</B><I>tasks</I> is defined in the cluster configuration (see
              <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_conf.html">sge_conf(5)</A></B>)

              The task id range specified in the option argument may be a
              single number, a simple range of the form n-m or a range with a
              step size. Hence, the task id range specified by 2-10:2 would
              result in the task id indexes 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10, for a total of
              5 identical tasks, each with the environment variable
              SGE_TASK_ID containing one of the 5 index numbers.

              All array job tasks inherit the same resource requests and
              attribute definitions as specified in the <I>qsub</I> or <I>qalter</I> command
              line, except for the <B>-t</B> option. The tasks are scheduled
              independently and, provided enough resources exist,
              concurrently, very much like separate jobs.  However, an array
              job or a sub-array there of can be accessed as a single unit by
              commands like <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qmod.html">qmod(1)</A></B> or <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qdel.html">qdel(1)</A></B>.  See the corresponding manual
              pages for further detail.

              Array jobs are commonly used to execute the same type of
              operation on varying input data sets correlated with the task
              index number. The number of tasks in a array job is unlimited.

              STDOUT and STDERR of array job tasks will be written into
              different files with the default location

              &lt;jobname&gt;.['e'|'o']&lt;job_id&gt;'.'&lt;task_id&gt;

              In order to change this default, the <B>-e</B> and <B>-o</B> options (see
              above) can be used together with the pseudo environment
              variables $HOME, $USER, $JOB_ID, $JOB_NAME, $HOSTNAME, and
              $SGE_TASK_ID.

              Note, that you can use the output redirection to divert the
              output of all tasks into the same file, but the result of this
              is undefined.

              If this option or a corresponding value in <I>qmon</I> is specified
              then this value will be passed to defined JSV instances as
              parameters with the names <B>t_min</B>, <B>t_max</B> and <B>t_step</B> (See <B>-jsv</B>
              option above or find more information concerning JSV in <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/jsv.html">jsv(1)</A></B>.)



       <B>-tc</B> <B>max_running_tasks</B>
              Available for <I>qsub</I> and <I>qalter</I> only.

              Used in conjunction with array jobs (see -t option) to set a
              self-imposed limit on the maximum number of concurrently running
              tasks per job.

              If this option, or a corresponding value in qmon is specified,
              then this value will be passed to defined JSV instances as a
              parameter with the name <B>tc</B>. (See the <B>-jsv</B> option above or find
              more information concerning JSV in <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/jsv.html">jsv(1)</A></B>.)

       <B>-terse</B> Available for <I>qsub</I> only.

              Causes <I>qsub</I> to display only the job-id of the job being
              submitted rather than the regular "Your job ..." string.  In
              case of an error the error is reported on stderr as usual.
              This can be helpful for scripts which need to parse <I>qsub</I> output
              to get the job-id.

              Information that this switch was specified during submission is
              not available in the JSV context.  (See <B>-jsv</B> option above or
              find more information concerning JSV in <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/jsv.html">jsv(1)</A></B>.)

       <B>-u</B> <B>username,...</B>
              Available for <I>qalter</I> only. Changes are only made on those jobs
              which were submitted by users specified in the list of
              usernames.  For managers it is possible to use the <B>qalter</B> <B>-u</B> <B>'*'</B>
              command to modify all jobs of all users.

              If you use the <B>-u</B> switch it is not permitted to specify an
              additional <I>wc</I><B>_</B><I>job</I><B>_</B><I>range</I><B>_</B><I>list</I>.

       <B>-v</B> <B>variable[=value],...</B>
              Available for <I>qsub</I>, <I>qrsh</I> (with command argument) and <I>qalter</I>.

              Defines or redefines the environment variables to be exported to
              the execution context of the job.  If the <B>-v</B> option is present
              Grid Engine will add the environment variables defined as
              arguments to the switch and, optionally, values of specified
              variables, to the execution context of the job.

              <I>Qalter</I> allows changing this option even while the job executes.
              The modified parameter will only be in effect after a restart or
              migration of the job, however.

              All environment variables specified with <B>-v</B>, <B>-V</B> or the DISPLAY
              variable provided with <B>-display</B> will be exported to the defined
              JSV instances only optionally when this is requested explicitly
              during the job submission verification.  (See <B>-jsv</B> option above
              or find more information concerning JSV in <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/jsv.html">jsv(1)</A></B>.)

       <B>-verbose</B>
              Available only for <I>qrsh</I> and <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qmake.html">qmake(1)</A></B>.

              Unlike <I>qsh</I> and <I>qlogin</I>, <I>qrsh</I> does not output any informational
              messages while establishing the session, compliant with the
              standard <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/rsh.html">rsh(1)</A></B> and <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/rlogin.html">rlogin(1)</A></B> system calls.  If the option
              <B>-verbose</B> is set, <I>qrsh</I> behaves like the <I>qsh</I> and <I>qlogin</I> commands,
              printing information about the process of establishing the
              <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/rsh.html">rsh(1)</A></B> or <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/rlogin.html">rlogin(1)</A></B> session.

       <B>-verify</B>
              Available for <I>qsub</I>, <I>qsh</I>, <I>qrsh</I>, <I>qlogin</I> and <I>qalter</I>.

              Instead of submitting a job, prints detailed information about
              the would-be job as though <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qstat.html">qstat(1)</A></B> -j were used, including the
              effects of command-line parameters and the external environment.

       <B>-V</B>     Available for <I>qsub</I>, <I>qsh</I>, <I>qrsh</I> <I>with</I> <I>command</I> and <I>qalter</I>.

              Specifies that all environment variables active within the <I>qsub</I>
              utility be exported to the context of the job.

              All environment variables specified with <B>-v</B>, <B>-V</B> or the DISPLAY
              variable provided with <B>-display</B> will be exported to the defined
              JSV instances only optionally when this is requested explicitly
              during the job submission verification.  (See <B>-jsv</B> option above
              or find more information concerning JSV in <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/jsv.html">jsv(1)</A></B>.)

       <B>-w</B> <B>e</B>|<B>w</B>|<B>n</B>|<B>p</B>|<B>v</B>
              Available for <I>qsub</I>, <I>qsh</I>, <I>qrsh</I>, <I>qlogin</I> and <I>qalter</I>.

              Specifies a validation level applied to the job to be submitted
              (<I>qsub</I>, <I>qlogin</I>, and <I>qsh</I>) or the specified queued job (<I>qalter</I>).
              The information displayed indicates whether the job can possibly
              be scheduled assuming an empty system with no other jobs.
              Resource requests exceeding the configured maximal thresholds or
              requesting unavailable resource attributes are possible causes
              for jobs to fail this validation.

              The specifiers e, w, n and v define the following validation
              modes:

              `e'  error - jobs with invalid requests will be
                   rejected.
              `w'  warning - only a warning will be displayed
                   for invalid requests.
              `n'  none - switches off validation; the default for
                   <I>qsub</I>, <I>qalter</I>, <I>qrsh</I>, <I>qsh</I>
                   and <I>qlogin</I>.
              `p'  poke - does not submit the job but prints a
                   validation report based on a cluster as is with
                   all resource utilizations in place.
              `v'  verify - does not submit the job but prints a
                   validation report based on an empty cluster.

              Note, that the necessary checks are performance consuming and
              hence the checking is switched off by default.  It should also
              be noted that load values are not taken into account with the
              verification since they are assumed to be too volatile. To cause
              -w e verification to be passed at submission time, it is
              possible to specify non-volatile values (non-consumables) or
              maximum values (consumables) in complex_values.

              If this option, or a corresponding value in qmon is specified,
              then this value will be passed to defined JSV instances as a
              parameter with the name <B>tc</B>. (See the <B>-jsv</B> option above or find
              more information concerning JSV in <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/jsv.html">jsv(1)</A></B>.)

       <B>-wd</B> <B>working_dir</B>
              Available for <I>qsub</I>, <I>qsh</I>, <I>qrsh</I> and <I>qalter</I> only.

              Execute the job from the directory specified in working_dir.
              This switch will activate Grid Engine's path aliasing facility,
              if the corresponding configuration files are present (see
              <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_aliases.html">sge_aliases(5)</A></B>).

              <I>Qalter</I> allows changing this option even while the job executes.
              The modified parameter will only be in effect after a restart or
              migration of the job, however.  The parameter value will be
              available in defined JSV instances as parameter with the name
              <B>cwd</B>.  (See <B>-cwd</B> switch above or find more information concerning

              Available for <I>qsub</I>, <I>qrsh</I> and <I>qalter</I> only.

              Arguments to the job. Not valid if the script is entered from
              standard input.

              <I>Qalter</I> allows changing this option even while the job executes.
              The modified parameter will only be in effect after a restart or
              migration of the job, however.

              The number of command arguments is provided to configured JSV
              instances as parameter with the name <B>CMDARGS</B>. Also the argument
              values can by accessed. Argument names have the format

                      address a Grid Engine cell <I>qsub</I>, <I>qsh</I>, <I>qlogin</I> or <I>qalter</I>
                      use (in the order of precedence):

                             The name of the cell specified in the environment
                             variable SGE_CELL, if it is set.

                             The name of the default cell, i.e. <B>default</B>.


       <B>SGE_DEBUG_LEVEL</B>
                      If set, specifies that debug information should be
                      written to stderr. In addition the level of detail in
                      which debug information is generated is defined.

       <B>SGE_QMASTER_PORT</B>
                      If set, specifies the tcp port on which <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B>
                      is expected to listen for communication requests.  Most
                      installations will use a services map entry for the
                      service "sge_qmaster" instead to define that port.

       <B>DISPLAY</B>        For <I>qsh</I> jobs the DISPLAY has to be specified at job
                      submission.  If the DISPLAY is not set by using the
                      <B>-display</B> or the <B>-v</B> switch, the contents of the DISPLAY
                      environment variable are used as default.

       In addition to those environment variables specified to be exported to
       the job via the <B>-v</B> or the <B>-V</B> option (see above), <I>qsub</I>, <I>qsh</I>, and <I>qlogin</I>
       add the following variables with the indicated values to the variable
       list:


       <B>SGE_O_HOME</B>     the home directory of the submitting client.

       <B>SGE_O_HOST</B>     the name of the host on which the submitting client is
                      running.

       <B>SGE_O_LOGNAME</B>  the LOGNAME of the submitting client.

       <B>SGE_O_MAIL</B>     the MAIL of the submitting client. This is the mail
                      directory of the submitting client.

       <B>SGE_O_PATH</B>     the executable search path of the submitting client.

       <B>SGE_O_SHELL</B>    the SHELL of the submitting client.

       <B>SGE_O_TZ</B>       the time zone of the submitting client.

                      the submitting client.

       Furthermore, Grid Engine sets additional variables into the job's
       environment, as listed below.

       <B>ARC</B>

       <B>SGE_ARCH</B>       The Grid Engine architecture name of the node on which
                      the job is running. The name is compiled-in into the

       SGE_BINDING    Contains the selected operating system internal
                      processor numbers.  There might be more than the number
                      of selected cores in the presence of SMT or CMT because
                      each core could be represented by multiple processor
                      identifiers.  The processor numbers are space-separated.

       <B>SGE_CKPT_ENV</B>   Specifies the checkpointing environment (as selected
                      with the <B>-ckpt</B> option) under which a checkpointing job
                      executes. Only set for checkpointing jobs.

       <B>SGE_CKPT_DIR</B>   Only set for checkpointing jobs. Contains path <I>ckpt</I><B>_</B><I>dir</I>

                      stream of the job is diverted. Commonly used for
                      enhancing the output with error messages from prolog,
                      epilog, parallel environment start/stop or checkpointing
                      scripts.

       <B>SGE_STDOUT_PATH</B>
                      The pathname of the file to which the standard output
                      stream of the job is diverted. Commonly used for
                      enhancing the output with messages from prolog, epilog,
                      parallel environment start/stop or checkpointing

       <B>SGE_STDIN_PATH</B> The pathname of the file from which the standard input
                      stream of the job is taken. This variable might be used
                      in combination with SGE_O_HOST in prolog/epilog scripts
                      to transfer the input file from the submit to the
                      execution host.

                      The directory used by <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_shepherd.html">sge_shepherd(8)</A></B> to store job
                      related data during job execution. This directory is
                      owned by root or by a Grid Engine administrative account
                      and commonly is not open for read or write access to

                      records, for example. This environment variable is set
                      to "undefined" for non-array jobs. It is possible to
                      change the predefined value of this variable with <B>-v</B> or
                      <B>-V</B> (see options above).

       <B>SGE_TASK_FIRST</B> The index number of the first array job task (see <B>-t</B>
                      option above). It is possible to change the predefined

<H2>RESTRICTIONS</H2><PRE>
       There is no controlling terminal for batch jobs under Grid Engine, and
       any tests or actions on a controlling terminal will fail. If these
       operations are in your .login or .cshrc file, they may cause your job
       to abort.

       Insert the following test before any commands that are not pertinent to
       batch jobs in your .login:

              if ( $?JOB_NAME) then
                     echo "Grid Engine spooled job"
                     exit 0
              endif

       or in your .profile:

              if [ ! -z "$JOB_NAME" ] then

       The next example is a more complex Grid Engine script.

       =====================================================

       #!/bin/sh

       # Which account to be charged cpu time
       #$ -A santa_claus

       # date-time to run, format [[CC]yy]MMDDhhmm[.SS]
       #$ -a 12241200

       # to run I want 6 or more parallel processes
       # under the PE pvm. the processes require
       # 128M of memory
       #$ -pe pvm 6- -l mem=128

       # If I run on dec_x put stderr in /tmp/foo, if I
       # run on sun_y, put stderr in /usr/me/foo
       #$ -e dec_x:/tmp/foo,sun_y:/usr/me/foo

       # Send mail to these users
       #$ -M santa@nothpole,claus@northpole

       # Mail at beginning/end/on suspension
       #$ -m bes

       # Export these environmental variables
       #$ -v PVM_ROOT,FOOBAR=BAR

       # The job is located in the current
       # working directory.
       #$ -cwd
