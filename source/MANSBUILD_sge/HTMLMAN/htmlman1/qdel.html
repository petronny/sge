<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <I>Qdel</I> provides a means for a user/operator/manager to delete one or more
       jobs. A manager/operator can delete jobs belonging to any user, while a
       regular user can only delete his or her own jobs.  If a manager wants
       to delete another user's job, the manager can specify the job id. A
       manager using a job name or pattern must also specify the user's name
       via "-u wc_user_list". A "qdel wc_job_name" will delete only the jobs
       of the calling user by default.  <I>Qdel</I> deletes jobs in the order in
       which their job identifiers are presented. Find additional information
       concerning <I>wc</I><B>_</B><I>user</I><B>_</B><I>list</I> and <I>wc</I><B>_</B><I>job</I><B>_</B><I>list</I> in <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/sge_types.html">sge_types(1)</A></B>.


</PRE>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       <B>-f</B>     Force deletion of job(s). The job(s) are deleted from the list
              of jobs registered at <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B> even if the <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B>
              controlling the job(s) does not respond to the delete request
              sent by <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B>.

              Users who are neither Grid Engine managers nor operators can
              only use the <B>-f</B> option (for their own jobs) if the cluster
              configuration entry <B>qmaster_params</B> contains the flag
              ENABLE_FORCED_QDEL (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_conf.html">sge_conf(5)</A></B>).  However, the behavior for
              administrative and non-administrative users differs. Jobs are
              deleted from the Grid Engine database immediately in the case of
              administrators. Otherwise, a regular deletion is attempted first
              and a forced cancellation is only executed if the regular
              deletion was unsuccessful.

              Additionally, regular qdel requests can result in a forced
              deletion of a job if <B>ENABLE_FORCED_QDEL_IF_UNKNOWN</B> is set in the
              <B>qmaster_params</B> (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_conf.html">sge_conf(5)</A></B>).

       <B>-help</B>  Prints a listing of all options.

       <B>-t</B>     Deletes specified tasks of an array job. It means tasks created
              by the <I>qsub</I> <I>-t</I> command. For example, after creating an array job
              with the command "qsub -t 1-100 $SGE_ROOT/examples/sleeper.sh"
              it is possible to delete tasks 5-10 from the job array with the
              command "qdel job_id -t 5-10".  All other tasks (1-4 and 11-100)
              will be executed.

       <B>-u</B> <B>wc_user_list</B>
              Deletes only those jobs which were submitted by users specified
              in the list of usernames.  For managers it is possible to use
              <B>qdel</B> <B>-u</B> <B>"*"</B> to delete all jobs of all users. If a manager wants
              to delete a specific job of a user, he has to specify the user
              and the job. If no job is specified, all jobs from that user are
              deleted.

       <B>wc_job_range_list</B>
              A list of jobs which should be deleted.

<H2>ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES</H2><PRE>
       <B>SGE_ROOT</B>       Specifies the location of the Grid Engine standard
                      configuration files.

       <B>SGE_CELL</B>       If set, specifies the default Grid Engine cell. To
                      address a Grid Engine cell <I>qdel</I> uses (in the order of
                      precedence):

                             The name of the cell specified in the environment
                             variable SGE_CELL, if it is set.

                             The name of the default cell, i.e. <B>default</B>.


       <B>SGE_DEBUG_LEVEL</B>
                      If set, specifies that debug information should be
                      written to stderr. In addition the level of detail in
                      which debug information is generated is defined.

       <B>SGE_QMASTER_PORT</B>
                      If set, specifies the tcp port on which <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B>
                      is expected to listen for communication requests.  Most
                      installations will use a services map entry for the
                      service "sge_qmaster" instead to define that port.
