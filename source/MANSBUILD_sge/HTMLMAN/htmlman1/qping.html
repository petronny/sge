</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <I>Qping</I> is used to validate the runtime status of a Grid Engine service
       daemon. The current Grid Engine implementation allows one to query the
       SGE_QMASTER daemon and any running SGE_EXECD daemon. The qping command
       is used to send a SIM (Status Information Message) to the destination
       daemon. The communication layer of the specified daemon will respond
       with a SIRM (Status Information Response Message) which contains status
       information about the consulted daemon.

       The qping -dump and -dump_tag options allow an administrator to observe
       the communication protocol data flow of a Grid Engine service daemon.
       The qping -dump instruction must be started under the root account and
       on the host where the observed daemon is running.


</PRE>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
   <B>-f</B>
       Show full status information on each ping interval.

       <I>First</I> <I>output</I> <I>Line:</I> The first output line shows the date and time of the
       request.

       <I>SIRM</I> <I>version:</I> Internal version number of the SIRM (Status Information
       Response Message)

       <I>SIRM</I> <I>message</I> <I>id:</I> Current message id for this connection

       <I>start</I> <I>time:</I> Start time of daemon. The format is as follows:

       MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM:SS (seconds since 01.01.1970)

       <I>run</I> <I>time</I> <I>[s]:</I> Run time in seconds since start time

       <I>messages</I> <I>in</I> <I>read</I> <I>buffer:</I> Number of buffered messages in the
       communication read buffer. The messages are buffered for the
       application (daemon). When this number grows too large the daemon is
       not able to handle all messages sent to it.

       <I>messages</I> <I>in</I> <I>write</I> <I>buffer:</I> Number of buffered messages in the
       communication write buffer. The messages are sent from the application
       (daemon) to the connected clients, but the communication layer wasn't
       able to send the messages yet. If this number grows too large, the
       communication layer isn't able to send them as fast as the application
       (daemon) wants the messages to be sent.

       <I>nr.</I> <I>of</I> <I>connected</I> <I>clients:</I> This is the number of clients actually
       connected to this daemon, including the current qping connection.

       <I>status:</I> The status value of the daemon. This value depends on the
       application which replies to the qping request.  If the application
       does not provide any information, the status is 99999.  Here are the
       possible status information values for the Grid Engine daemons:

          qmaster:

             <I>0</I> There is no unusual timing situation.

             <I>1</I> One or more threads has reached warning timeout. This may
             happen when at least one thread does not increment its time stamp
             for an usually long time. A possible reason for this is a high
             workload for this thread.

             <I>2</I> One or more threads has reached error timeout. This may happen
             when at least one thread has not incremented its time stamp for
             longer than 10 minutes.

             <I>3</I> The time measurement is not initialized.

          execd:

             <I>0</I> There is no unusual timing situation.

             <I>1</I> Dispatcher has reached warning timeout. This may happen when
             the dispatcher does not increment its time stamp for an unusually
             long time. A possible reason for this is a high workload.

             <I>2</I> Dispatcher has reached error timeout. This may happen when the
             dispatcher has not incremented its time stamp for longer than 10
             minutes.

             <I>3</I> The time measurement is not initialized.


       <I>info:</I> Status message of the daemon. This value depends on the
       application which replies to the qping request.  If the application
       does not provide any information the info message is "not available".
       Here are the possible status information values for the Grid Engine
       daemons:


          qmaster:

             The info message contains information about the qmaster threads,
             followed by a thread state and time information. Each time one of
             the known threads passes through its main loop the time
             information is updated. Since the qmaster has two message
             threads, every message thread updates the time. This means the
             timeout for the message thread (MT) can only occur when no
             message thread is active anymore:

                THREAD_NAME: THREAD_STATE (THREAD_TIME)

                THREAD_NAME:
                   MAIN: Main thread
                   signaler: Signal thread
                   event_master: Event master thread
                   timer: Timer thread
                   worker: Worker thread
                   listener: Listener thread
                   scheduler: Scheduler thread
                   jvm: Java thread

                   The thread names above will be followed by a 3 digit number.

                THREAD_STATE:
                   R: Running
                   W: Warning
                   E: Error

                THREAD_TIME:
                   Time since last timestamp updating.

             After the dispatcher information comes an additional information
             string which describes the complete application status.

          execd:

             The info message contains information for the execd job
             dispatcher:
                dispatcher: STATE (TIME)

             STATE:
                R: Running
                W: Warning
                E: Error

             TIME:
                Time since last timestamp updating.

          After the thread information comes an additional information string
          which describes the application status.

    <I>Monitor:</I> If available, displays statistics on a thread. The data for each
    thread is displayed in one line. The format of this line can be changed at
    any time. Only the master implements monitoring.


   <B>-help</B>
       Prints a list of all options.


   <B>-i</B> <B>interval</B>
       Set qping interval.

       The default interval is one second. Qping will send a SIM (Status
       Information Message) after each interval.


   <B>-info</B>
       Show full status information (see <B>-f</B> for more information) and exit.
       The exit value 0 indicates no error. On errors qping returns with 1.


   <B>-noalias</B>
       Ignore host_aliases file, which is located at
       <I>&lt;sge</I><B>_</B><I>root&gt;/&lt;cell&gt;/common/host</I><B>_</B><I>aliases.</I>  If this option is used it is
       not necessary to set any Grid Engine environment variable.


   <B>-ssl</B>
       This option can be used to specify an SSL (Secure Socket Layer)
       configuration. qping will use the configuration to connect to services
       running SSL. If the Grid Engine settings file is not sourced, you have
       to use the -noalias option to bypass the need for the SGE_ROOT
       environment variable.  The following environment variables are used to
       specify your certificates:
         SSL_CA_CERT_FILE - CA certificate file
         SSL_CERT_FILE    - certificates file
         SSL_KEY_FILE     - key file
         SSL_RAND_FILE    - rand file


   <B>-tcp</B>
       This option is used to select TCP/IP as the protocol used to connect to
       other services.


   <B>-nonewline</B>
       Dump output will not have a linebreak within a message, and binary
       messages are not unpacked.


   <B>-dump</B>
       This option allows an administrator to observe the communication
       protocol data flow of a Grid Engine service daemon. The qping -dump
       instruction must be started as root and on the host where the observed
       daemon is running.

       The output is written to stdout. The environment variable
       "SGE_QPING_OUTPUT_FORMAT" can be set to hide columns, set a default
       column width or to set a hostname output format. The value of the
       environment variable can be set to any combination of the following
       specifiers separated by a space character:
              "h:X"   -&gt; hide column X
              "s:X"   -&gt; show column X
              "w:X:Y" -&gt; set width of column X to Y
              "hn:X"  -&gt; set hostname output parameter X.
                         X values are "long" or "short"

       Run qping -help to see which columns are available.



   <B>-dump_tag</B> <B>tag</B> <B>[param]</B>
       This option has the same meaning as -dump, but can provide more
       information by specifying the debug level and message types qping
       should print:
          <B>-dump_tag</B> <B>ALL</B> <I>debug</I> <I>level</I>
             This option shows all possible debug messages (APP+MSG) for the
             debug levels, ERROR, WARNING, INFO, DEBUG and DPRINTF. The
             contacted service must support this kind of debugging.  This
             option is not currently implemented.
          <B>-dump_tag</B> <B>APP</B> <I>debug</I> <I>level</I>
             This option shows only application debug messages for the debug
             levels, ERROR, WARNING, INFO, DEBUG and DPRINTF. The contacted
             service must support this kind of debugging.  This option is not
             currently implemented.
          -dump_tag MSG
             This option has the same behavior as the -dump option.


   <B>host</B>
       Host where daemon is running.


   <B>port</B>
       Port which daemon has bound (used sge_qmaster/sge_execd port number).


   <B>name</B>
       Name of communication endpoint ("qmaster" or "execd"). A communication
       endpoint is a triplet of hostname/endpoint name/endpoint id (e.g.
       hostA/qmaster/1 or subhost/qstat/4).


   <B>id</B>
       Id of communication endpoint ("1" for daemons)
