       qrdel - delete Grid Engine Advance Reservations (AR)


</PRE>
<H2>SYNTAX</H2><PRE>
       <B>qrdel</B> [<B>-f</B>] [<B>-help</B>] [<B>-u</B> <I>wc</I><B>_</B><I>user</I><B>_</B><I>list</I>] <I>wc</I><B>_</B><I>ar</I><B>_</B><I>list</I>


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <I>Qrdel</I> provides a means for a user/operator/manager to delete one or
       more Advance Reservations (AR). A manager/operator can delete ARs
       belonging to any user, while a regular user can only delete his or her
       own ARs.  If a manager wants to delete another user's AR, the manager
       can specify the AR id.  By default, "qrdel wc_ar_name" will delete only
       the ARs belonging to that user. A manager is able to delete another
       user's AR via "-u wc_user_list".  Jobs referring to an AR tagged for
       deletion will also be removed.  Only if all jobs referring to an AR are
       removed from the Grid Engine database will the AR also be removed.

       <I>Qrdel</I> deletes ARs in the order in which the AR identifiers are
       presented. Find additional information concerning <I>wc</I><B>_</B><I>user</I><B>_</B><I>list</I> and
       <I>wc</I><B>_</B><I>ar</I><B>_</B><I>list</I> in <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/sge_types.html">sge_types(1)</A></B>.


</PRE>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       <B>-f</B>     Force action for AR. The AR and the jobs using the AR are
              deleted from the Grid Engine queuing system even if the
              <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> controlling the AR jobs does not respond to the
              delete request sent by the <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B>.
              Users which have neither Grid Engine manager nor operator status
              can only use the <B>-f</B> option for their own ARs.

       <B>-help</B>  Prints a list of all options.

       <B>-u</B> <B>wc_user_list</B>
              Deletes only those ARs which were submitted by users specified
              in the list of usernames.  For managers, it is possible to use
              <B>qrdel</B> <B>-u</B> <B>"*"</B> to delete all ARs for all users. If a manager wants
              to delete a specific AR for a user, he has to specify the user
              and the AR id. If no AR is specified, all ARs belonging to that
              user are deleted.

       <B>wc_ar_list</B>
              A list of AR id's that should be deleted

<H2>ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES</H2><PRE>
       <B>SGE_ROOT</B>       Specifies the location of the Grid Engine standard
                      configuration files.

       <B>SGE_CELL</B>       If set, specifies the default Grid Engine cell. To
                      address a Grid Engine cell <I>qrdel</I> uses (in the order of
                      precedence):

                             The name of the cell specified in the environment
                             variable SGE_CELL, if it is set.

                             The name of the default cell, i.e. <B>default</B>.


       <B>SGE_DEBUG_LEVEL</B>
                      If set, specifies that debug information should be
                      written to stderr. In addition the level of detail in
                      which debug information is generated is defined.

       <B>SGE_QMASTER_PORT</B>
                      If set, specifies the tcp port on which the
                      <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B> is expected to listen for communication
                      requests.  Most installations will use a service map
                      entry for the service "sge_qmaster" instead of defining
                      the port.
