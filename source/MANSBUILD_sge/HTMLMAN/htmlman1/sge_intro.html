<H2>NAME</H2><PRE>
       sge_intro - Grid Engine, a facility for executing jobs on remote
       machines


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       Grid Engine is a facility for executing Unix-like batch jobs (shell
       scripts or binaries) on a pool of cooperating CPUs. Jobs are queued and
       executed remotely according to defined policies.  The CPUs may be in
       desktop systems, with jobs run on them at times when they would
       otherwise be idle or only lightly loaded. The work load may be
       distributed according to the (generalized) load situation of each
       machine and the resource requirements of the jobs.

       User level checkpointing programs are supported and a transparent
       checkpointing mechanism is provided (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/sge_ckpt.html">sge_ckpt(1)</A></B>).  Checkpointing
       jobs migrate from system to system without user intervention on load
       demand. In addition to simple batch jobs, interactive jobs and parallel
       jobs can also be submitted to Grid Engine.


</PRE>
<H2>USER INTERFACE</H2><PRE>
       The Grid Engine user interface consists of several programs which are
       described separately.

       <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qacct.html">qacct(1)</A></B>
              <I>qacct</I> extracts arbitrary accounting information from the cluster
              logfile.

       <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qalter.html">qalter(1)</A></B>
              <I>qalter</I> changes the characteristics of already submitted jobs.

       <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qconf.html">qconf(1)</A></B>
              <I>qconf</I> provides the user interface for configuring, modifying,
              deleting and querying queues and the cluster configuration.

       <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qdel.html">qdel(1)</A></B>
              <I>qdel</I> provides the means for a user/operator/manager to cancel
              jobs.

       <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qhold.html">qhold(1)</A></B>
              <I>qhold</I> holds back submitted jobs from execution.

       <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qhost.html">qhost(1)</A></B>
              <I>qhost</I> displays status information about Grid Engine execution
              hosts.

       <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qlogin.html">qlogin(1)</A></B>
              <I>qlogin</I> initiates a telnet or similar login session with
              automatic selection of a suitable host.

       <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qmake.html">qmake(1)</A></B>
              <I>qmake</I> is a replacement for the standard Unix <I>make</I> facility. It
              extends make with an ability to distribute independent make
              steps across a cluster of suitable machines.

       <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qmod.html">qmod(1)</A></B>
              <I>qmod</I> allows the owner(s) of a queue to suspend and enable
              queues, e.g. all queues associated with his machine (all
              currently active processes in this queue are also signaled) or
              to suspend and enable jobs executing in the queues.

       <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qmon.html">qmon(1)</A></B>
              <I>qmon</I> provides a Motif command interface to all Grid Engine
              functions. The status of all, or a private selection of, the
              configured queues is displayed on-line by changing colors at
              corresponding queue icons.

       <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qquota.html">qquota(1)</A></B>
              <I>qquota</I> provides a status listing of all currently used resource
              quotas (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/sge_resource_quota.html">sge_resource_quota(5)</A></B>).

       <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qresub.html">qresub(1)</A></B>
              <I>qresub</I> creates new jobs by copying currently running or pending
              jobs.

       <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qrls.html">qrls(1)</A></B>
              <I>qrls</I> releases holds from jobs previously assigned to them e.g.
              via <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qhold.html">qhold(1)</A></B> (see above).

       <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qrdel.html">qrdel(1)</A></B>
              <I>qrdel</I> provides the means to cancel advance reservations.

       <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qrsh.html">qrsh(1)</A></B>
              <I>qrsh</I> can be used for various purposes such as providing remote
              execution of interactive applications via Grid Engine comparable
              to the standard Unix facility rsh, to allow for the submission
              of batch jobs which, upon execution, support terminal I/O
              (standard/error output and standard input) and terminal control,
              to provide a batch job submission client which remains active
              until the job has finished or to allow for the Grid Engine-
              controlled remote execution of the tasks of parallel jobs.

       <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qrstat.html">qrstat(1)</A></B>
              <I>qrstat</I> provides a status listing of all advance reservations in
              the cluster.

       <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qrsub.html">qrsub(1)</A></B>
              <I>qrsub</I> is the user interface for submitting an advance
              reservation to Grid Engine.

       <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qselect.html">qselect(1)</A></B>
              <I>qselect</I> prints a list of queue names corresponding to specified
              selection criteria. The output of <I>qselect</I> is usually fed into
              other Grid Engine commands to apply actions on a selected set of
              queues.

       <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsh.html">qsh(1)</A></B> <I>qsh</I> opens an interactive shell (in an <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/xterm.html">xterm(1)</A></B>) on a low loaded
              host. Any kind of interactive job can be run in this shell.

       <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qstat.html">qstat(1)</A></B>
              <I>qstat</I> provides a status listing of all jobs and queues
              associated with the cluster.

       <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qtcsh.html">qtcsh(1)</A></B>
              <I>qtcsh</I> is a fully compatible replacement for the widely known and
              used Unix C-Shell (<I>csh</I>) derivative <I>tcsh</I>. It provides a command-
              shell with the extension of transparently distributing execution
              of designated applications to suitable and lightly loaded hosts
              via Grid Engine.

       <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qsub.html">qsub(1)</A></B>
              <I>qsub</I> is the user interface for submitting a job to Grid Engine.
