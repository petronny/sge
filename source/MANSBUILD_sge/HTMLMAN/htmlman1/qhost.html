</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <I>qhost</I> shows the current status of the available Grid Engine hosts,
       queues and the jobs associated with the queues. Selection options allow
       you to get information about specific hosts, queues, jobs or users.  If
       multiple selections are done a host is only displayed if all selection
       criteria for a host are met.  Without any options <I>qhost</I> will display a
       list of all hosts without queue or job information.


</PRE>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       <B>-F</B> [ <B>resource_name,...</B> ]
              <I>qhost</I> will present a detailed listing of the current resource
              availability per host with respect to all resources (if the
              option argument is omitted) or with respect to those resources
              contained in the resource_name list. Please refer to the
              description of the <B>Full</B> <B>Format</B> in section <B>OUTPUT</B> <B>FORMATS</B> below
              for further detail.

       <B>-help</B>  Prints a listing of all options.

       <B>-h</B> <B>host_list</B>
              Prints a list of all hosts contained in host_list.

       <B>-j</B>     Prints all jobs running on the queues hosted by the shown hosts.
              This switch calls <B>-q</B> implicitly.

       <B>-l</B> <B>resource</B>[<B>=value</B>],...
              Defines the resources to be granted by the hosts which should be
              included in the host list output. Matching is performed on hosts
              based on non-mutable resource availability information only.
              That means load values are always ignored except the so-called
              static load values (i.e. "arch", "num_proc", "mem_total",
              "swap_total" and "virtual_total") ones. Also consumable
              utilization is ignored.  If there are multiple -l resource
              requests they will be concatenated by a logical AND: a host
              needs to match all resources to be displayed.

       <B>-ncb</B>   This command line switch can be used in order to get 6.2u5
              compatible output with other <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qhost.html">qhost(1)</A></B> command line switches. In
              that case the output of the corresponding command will suppress
              information concerning the execution host topology. Note that
              this option will be removed in the next major version.

       <B>-q</B>     Show information about the queues instances hosted by the
              displayed hosts.

       <B>-u</B> <B>user,...</B>
              Display information only on those jobs and queues being
              associated with the users from the given user list.

       <B>-xml</B>   This option can be used with all other options and changes the
              output to XML. The used schemas are referenced in the XML
              output. The output is printed to stdout.

              If the <B>-xml</B> parameter is combined with <B>-ncb</B> then the XML output
              will contain 6.2u5 compatible output.


</PRE>
<H2>OUTPUT FORMATS</H2><PRE>
       Depending on the presence or absence of the <B>-q</B> or <B>-F</B> and <B>-j</B> option
       three output formats need to be differentiated.

   <B>Default</B> <B>Format</B> <B>(without</B> <B>-q,</B> <B>-F</B> <B>and</B> <B>-j)</B>
       For each host one line is printed. The output consists of consisting of

       <B>o</B>  the Hostname

       <B>o</B>  the Architecture.

       <B>o</B>  the  Number of processors.

       <B>o</B>  the Load.

       <B>o</B>  the Total Memory.

       <B>o</B>  the Used Memory.

       <B>o</B>  the Total Swapspace.

       <B>o</B>  the Used Swapspace.

       More details can be found in the file
       <I>$SGE</I><B>_</B><I>ROOT/doc/load</I><B>_</B><I>parameters.asc</I>.

       If the <B>-q</B> option is supplied, each host status line also contains extra
       lines for every queue hosted by the host consisting of,

       <B>o</B>  the queue name.

       <B>o</B>  the queue type - one of B(atch), I(nteractive), C(heckpointing),
          P(arallel), or combinations thereof,

       <B>o</B>  the number of reserved (by advance reservation, not resource
          reservation), used and, available job slots,

       <B>o</B>  the state of the queue - one of u(nknown) if the corresponding
          <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> cannot be contacted, a(larm), A(larm), C(alendar
          suspended), s(uspended), S(ubordinate), d(isabled), D(isabled),
          E(rror), (c)configuration ambiguous, or combinations thereof.

       If the state is a(alarm) at least one of the load thresholds defined in
       the <I>load</I><B>_</B><I>thresholds</I> list of the queue configuration (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html">queue_conf(5)</A></B>)
       is currently exceeded, which prevents from scheduling further jobs to
       that queue.

       As opposed to this, the state A(larm) indicates that at least one of
       the suspend thresholds of the queue (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html">queue_conf(5)</A></B>) is currently
       exceeded. This will result in jobs running in that queue being
       successively suspended until no threshold is violated.

       The states s(uspended) and d(isabled) can be assigned to queues and
       released via the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qmod.html">qmod(1)</A></B> command. Suspending a queue will cause all
       jobs executing in that queue to be suspended.

       The states D(isabled) and C(alendar suspended) indicate that the queue
       has been disabled or suspended automatically via the calendar facility
       of Grid Engine (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/calendar_conf.html">calendar_conf(5)</A></B>), while the S(ubordinate) state
       indicates, that the queue has been suspend via subordination to another
       queue (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html">queue_conf(5)</A></B> for details). When suspending a queue
       (regardless of the cause) all jobs executing in that queue are
       suspended too.

       If an E(rror) state is displayed for a queue, <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> on that host
       was unable to locate the <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_shepherd.html">sge_shepherd(8)</A></B> executable on that host in
       order to start a job. Please check the error logfile of that
       <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_execd.html">sge_execd(8)</A></B> for leads on how to resolve the problem. Please enable the
       queue afterwards via the <B>-c</B> option of the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qmod.html">qmod(1)</A></B> command manually.

       The c(onfiguration ambiguous) state indicates a problem with
       overlapping hosts groups (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/queue_conf.html">queue_conf(5)</A></B>).  Use <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qstat.html">qstat(1)</A></B>'s <B>-explain</B>
       <B>c</B> to diagnose it.

       If the <B>-F</B> option was used, resource availability information is printed
       following the host status line. For each resource (as selected in an
       option argument to <B>-F</B> or for all resources if the option argument was
       omitted) a single line is displayed with the following format:

       <B>o</B>  a one letter specifier indicating whether the current resource
          availability value was dominated by either
          `<B>g</B>' - a cluster global,
          `<B>h</B>' - a host total or

       <B>o</B>  a second one letter specifier indicating the source for the current
          resource availability value, being one of
          `<B>l</B>' - a load value reported for the resource,
          `<B>L</B>' - a load value for the resource after administrator defined load
          scaling has been applied,
          `<B>c</B>' - availability derived from the consumable resources facility
          (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/complexes.html">complexes(5)</A></B>),
          `<B>f</B>' - a fixed availability definition derived from a non-consumable
          complex attribute or a fixed resource limit.

       <B>o</B>  after a colon the name of the resource on which information is
          displayed.

       <B>o</B>  after an equal sign the current resource availability value.

       The displayed availability values and the sources from which they
       derive are always the minimum values of all possible combinations.
       Hence, for example, a line of the form "qf:h_vmem=4G" indicates that a
       queue currently has a maximum availability in virtual memory of 4
       Gigabyte, where this value is a fixed value (e.g. a resource limit in
       the queue configuration) and it is queue dominated, i.e. the host in
       total may have more virtual memory available than this, but the queue
       doesn't allow for more. Contrarily a line "hl:h_vmem=4G" would also
       indicate an upper bound of 4 Gigabyte virtual memory availability, but
       the limit would be derived from a load value currently reported for the
       host. So while the queue might allow for jobs with higher virtual
       memory requirements, the host on which this particular queue resides
       currently only has 4 Gigabyte available.

       After the queue status line (in case of <B>-j</B>) a single line is printed
       for each job running currently in this queue. Each job status line
       contains

       <B>o</B>  the job ID,

       <B>o</B>  the job name,

       <B>o</B>  the job owner name,

       <B>o</B>  the status of the job - one of t(ransfering), r(unning),
          R(estarted), s(uspended), S(uspended) or T(hreshold) (see the
          <B>Reduced</B> <B>Format</B> section for detailed information),

       <B>o</B>  the start date and time and the function of the job (MASTER or SLAVE
          - only meaningful in case of a parallel job) and

       <B>o</B>  the priority of the jobs.


</PRE>
<H2>ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES</H2><PRE>
       <B>SGE_ROOT</B>       Specifies the location of the Grid Engine standard
                      configuration files.

       <B>SGE_CELL</B>       If set, specifies the default Grid Engine cell. To
                      address a Grid Engine cell <I>qhost</I> uses (in the order of
                      precedence):

                             The name of the cell specified in the environment
                             variable SGE_CELL, if it is set.

                             The name of the default cell, i.e. <B>default</B>.


       <B>SGE_DEBUG_LEVEL</B>
                      If set, specifies that debug information should be
                      written to stderr. In addition the level of detail in
                      which debug information is generated is defined.

       <B>SGE_QMASTER_PORT</B>
                      If set, specifies the tcp port on which <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B>
                      is expected to listen for communication requests.  Most
                      installations will use a services map entry for the
                      service "sge_qmaster" instead to define that port.
