<H2>NAME</H2><PRE>
       qtcsh - tcsh v6.09 with transparent remote execution by use of qrsh.


</PRE>
<H2>SYNTAX</H2><PRE>
       <B>qtcsh</B> [ <B>tcsh</B> <B>options</B> | <B>-ABLR</B> ]


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <I>Qtcsh</I> is an extension to the popular <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/csh.html">csh(1)</A></B> derivative <I>tcsh</I>. It allows
       the transparent remote execution commands entered in <I>qtcsh</I> controlled
       via Grid Engine.  <I>Qtcsh</I> can be used as interactive command interpreter
       as well as for the processing of <I>tcsh</I> shell scripts.

       When invoked, <I>qtcsh</I> identifies which commands are to be run remotely
       and which are not. For this purpose the files
       &lt;sge_root&gt;/&lt;cell&gt;/common/qtask and ~/.qtask are processed. Each line in
       these files defines a command that is intended to be run remotely (see
       <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/qtask.html">qtask(5)</A></B> for a definition of the file format). The .qtask file in the
       user's home directory contains the user's remote task specification,
       while the file in the common directory is maintained by the
       administrator and defines a cluster-wide default behavior.  The
       contents of the administrator supplied <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/qtask.html">qtask(5)</A></B> file are completely
       overridden in case there is an appropriate entry in the users <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/qtask.html">qtask(5)</A></B>
       file.  This is prevented in case an exclamation mark is prefixed to the
       command name in the administrators qtask file.

       <I>Qtcsh</I> always attempts to start the designated tasks remotely via
       <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/qrsh.html">qrsh(1)</A></B>.  Exceptions are

       <B>o</B>  if the user enters such commands via a relative or absolute pathname
          instead of the stand-alone command name (see <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/qtask.html">qtask(5)</A></B> for more
          information).

       <B>o</B>  if the environment variable JOB_ID is set and thus <I>qtcsh</I> assumes
          that execution already happens remotely within a Grid Engine job and
          thus executes tasks locally. This avoids unwanted recursions but can
          be overridden by the command-line option <B>-R</B> and the built-in command
          <I>qrshmode</I> <I>-R</I> (see corresponding descriptions below).

       <B>o</B>  if <I>qtcsh</I> cannot establish a connection of Grid Engine during start-
          up. This allows to use <I>qtcsh</I> as login shell without the danger of
          being blocked when no Grid Engine service is available.

       <I>Qtcsh</I> can operate in three different modes determining whether

       <B>o</B>  tasks are executed remotely.

       <B>o</B>  immediate or batch execution is requested.

       <B>o</B>  status output is verbose or only in case of any errors.

       These modes either can be controlled by the command-line switches
       described below during <I>qtcsh</I> invocation or within an executing <I>qtcsh</I>
       via the built-in command <I>qrshmode</I> as described in section <B>BUILT-IN</B>
       <B>COMMANDS</B>.


</PRE>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       The options listed below are specific to <I>qtcsh</I>. The user is referred to
       the <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/tcsh.html">tcsh(1)</A></B> documentation for the explanation of further options.


       <B>-A</B>     Switches <I>qtcsh</I> in verbose mode causing diagnostic output in case
              of remote execution.

       <B>-B</B>     Switches remote task execution to batch mode. Tasks submitted to
              Grid Engine will be queued if they cannot start immediately.  As
              a consequence, <I>qtcsh</I> may block until the queued task can be
              started by Grid Engine. While this behavior probably is
              undesirable during an interactive session, it may be very useful
              for execution of shell scripts through <I>qtcsh</I> as it avoids
              failure of the scripts due to temporarily unavailable resources
              for particular tasks.

       <B>-L</B>     Switches off default behavior of remote execution of commands.
              Causes all commands to be executed locally even if they are
              contained in one of the <B><A HREF="../htmlman5/qtask.html">qtask(5)</A></B> files.

       <B>-R</B>     Enforces remote execution of commands even if JOB_ID is set as
              environment variable.


</PRE>
<H2>BUILT-IN COMMANDS</H2><PRE>
       This section only describes additional shell builtin commands which are
       not available in standard <B><A HREF="../htmlman1/tcsh.html">tcsh(1)</A></B>.


       <B>qrshmode</B> [<B>-ANBILR</B>]
              Without options, the current operational mode of <I>qtcsh</I> is
              displayed. The options have the following effect:

              -A   switch to verbose output mode
              -N   switch to non-verbose output mode
              -B   switch to batch execution mode
              -I   switch to immediate execution mode
              -L   always execute commands locally
              -R   execute configured commands remotely



</PRE>
<H2>ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES</H2><PRE>
       <B>SGE_ROOT</B>       Specifies the location of the Grid Engine standard
                      configuration files.

       <B>SGE_CELL</B>       If set, specifies the default Grid Engine cell. To
                      address a Grid Engine cell <I>qtcsh</I> uses (in the order of
                      precedence):

                             The name of the cell specified in the environment
                             variable SGE_CELL, if it is set.

                             The name of the default cell, i.e. <B>default</B>.


       <B>SGE_DEBUG_LEVEL</B>
                      If set, specifies that debug information should be
                      written to stderr. In addition the level of detail in
                      which debug information is generated is defined.

       <B>SGE_QMASTER_PORT</B>
                      If set, specifies the tcp port on which <B><A HREF="../htmlman8/sge_qmaster.html">sge_qmaster(8)</A></B>
                      is expected to listen for communication requests.  Most
                      installations will use a services map entry for the
                      service "sge_qmaster" instead to define that port.

       <B>JOB_ID</B>         If set when starting <I>qtcsh</I> the local operation mode is
                      activated implicitly as if the <B>-L</B> option was specified.
