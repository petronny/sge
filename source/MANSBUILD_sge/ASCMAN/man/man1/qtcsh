       _Q_t_c_s_h  is an extension to the popular _c_s_h(1) derivative _t_c_s_h. It allows
       the transparent remote execution commands entered in  _q_t_c_s_h  controlled
       via  Grid Engine.  _Q_t_c_s_h can be used as interactive command interpreter
       as well as for the processing of _t_c_s_h shell scripts.

       When invoked, _q_t_c_s_h identifies which commands are to  be  run  remotely
       and  which  are  not. For this purpose the files <sge_root>/<cell>/com-
       mon/qtask and ~/.qtask are processed. Each line in these files  defines
       a command that is intended to be run remotely (see _q_t_a_s_k(5) for a defi-
       nition of the file format). The .qtask file in the user's  home  direc-
       tory  contains  the user's remote task specification, while the file in
       the common directory is maintained by the administrator and  defines  a
       cluster-wide  default behavior.  The contents of the administrator sup-
       plied _q_t_a_s_k(5) file are completely  overridden  in  case  there  is  an
       appropriate  entry  in  the  users _q_t_a_s_k(5) file.  This is prevented in
       case an exclamation mark is prefixed to the command name in the  admin-
       istrators qtask file.

       _Q_t_c_s_h  always  attempts  to  start  the  designated  tasks remotely via
       _q_r_s_h(1).  Exceptions are

       +o  if the user enters such commands via a relative or absolute pathname
          instead  of  the  stand-alone  command  name  (see _q_t_a_s_k(5) for more
          information).

       +o  if the environment variable JOB_ID is set  and  thus  _q_t_c_s_h  assumes
          that execution already happens remotely within a Grid Engine job and
          thus executes tasks locally. This avoids unwanted recursions but can
          be overridden by the command-line option --RR and the built-in command
          _q_r_s_h_m_o_d_e _-_R (see corresponding descriptions below).

       +o  if _q_t_c_s_h cannot establish a connection of Grid Engine during  start-
          up.  This  allows  to use _q_t_c_s_h as login shell without the danger of
          being blocked when no Grid Engine service is available.

       _Q_t_c_s_h can operate in three different modes determining whether

       +o  tasks are executed remotely.

       +o  immediate or batch execution is requested.

       +o  status output is verbose or only in case of any errors.

       These modes either can  be  controlled  by  the  command-line  switches
       described  below  during  _q_t_c_s_h invocation or within an executing _q_t_c_s_h
       via the built-in command _q_r_s_h_m_o_d_e as described in section BBUUIILLTT--IINN CCOOMM--
       MMAANNDDSS.

       The options listed below are specific to _q_t_c_s_h. The user is referred to
       the _t_c_s_h(1) documentation for the explanation of further options.


       --AA     Switches _q_t_c_s_h in verbose mode causing diagnostic output in case
              of remote execution.

       --BB     Switches remote task execution to batch mode. Tasks submitted to
              Grid Engine will be queued if they cannot start immediately.  As
              a  consequence,  _q_t_c_s_h  may  block  until the queued task can be
              started by Grid Engine. While this behavior probably is undesir-
              able  during  an  interactive session, it may be very useful for
              execution of shell scripts through _q_t_c_s_h as it avoids failure of
              the scripts due to temporarily unavailable resources for partic-
              ular tasks.

       --LL     Switches off default behavior of remote execution  of  commands.
              Causes all commands to be executed locally even if they are con-
              tained in one of the _q_t_a_s_k(5) files.

       --RR     Enforces remote execution of commands even if JOB_ID is  set  as
              environment variable.

       This section only describes additional shell builtin commands which are
       not available in standard _t_c_s_h(1).

              Without options, the current operational mode of _q_t_c_s_h  is  dis-
              played. The options have the following effect:

              -A   switch to verbose output mode
              -N   switch to non-verbose output mode
              -B   switch to batch execution mode
              -I   switch to immediate execution mode
              -L   always execute commands locally
              -R   execute configured commands remotely

       SSGGEE__CCEELLLL       If set, specifies  the  default  Grid  Engine  cell.  To
                      address  a  Grid Engine cell _q_t_c_s_h uses (in the order of
                      precedence):

                             The name of the cell specified in the environment
                             variable SGE_CELL, if it is set.

                             The name of the default cell, i.e. ddeeffaauulltt.

                      If set, specifies that debug information should be writ-
                      ten to stderr. In addition the level of detail in  which
                      debug information is generated is defined.

                      If  set,  specifies the tcp port on which _s_g_e___q_m_a_s_t_e_r(8)
                      is expected to listen for communication requests.   Most
                      installations will use a services map entry for the ser-
                      vice "sge_qmaster" instead to define that port.

       JJOOBB__IIDD         If set when starting _q_t_c_s_h the local operation  mode  is
                      activated implicitly as if the --LL option was specified.
