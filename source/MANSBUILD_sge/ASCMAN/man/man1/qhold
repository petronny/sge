       _Q_h_o_l_d  provides  a means for a user/operator/manager to place so called
       _h_o_l_d_s on one or more jobs pending scheduling for execution.  As long as
       any  type  of  hold  is  assigned to a job, the job is not eligible for
       scheduling.

       Holds can be removed with the _q_r_l_s(1) or _q_a_l_t_e_r(1) command.

       There are three different types of holds:

       uusseerr   User holds can be assigned and removed  by  managers,  operators
              and the owner of the jobs.

       ooppeerraattoorr
              Operator holds can be assigned and removed by managers and oper-
              ators.

       ssyysstteemm System holds can be assigned and removed by managers only.

       If no hold type is specified with the --hh option (see  below)  the  user
       hold is assumed by default.

       An  alternate  way  to  assign holds to jobs is the _q_s_u_b(1) or the _q_a_l_-
       _t_e_r(1) command (see the _-_h option).

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       --hh {uu|oo|ss},...
              Assign a u(ser), o(perator) or s(system) hold, or a  combination
              thereof, to one or more jobs.

       --hheellpp  Prints a listing of all options.

       --uu uusseerrnnaammee,,......
              Changes  are  only  made  on  those jobs which were submitted by
              users specified in the list of usernames.  Managers are  allowed
              to  use  the  qqhhoolldd --uu ""**"" command to set a hold for all jobs of
              all users.

              If a user uses the --uu switch, the user may specify an additional
              _j_o_b_/_t_a_s_k___i_d___l_i_s_t.

       jjoobb//ttaasskk__iidd__lliisstt
              Specified by the following form:

                  _j_o_b___i_d_[_._t_a_s_k___r_a_n_g_e_]_[_,_j_o_b___i_d_[_._t_a_s_k___r_a_n_g_e_]_,_._._._]

              If  present,  the  _t_a_s_k___r_a_n_g_e  restricts the effect of the _q_h_o_l_d
              operation to the array job task range specified as suffix to the
              job  id  (see  the  --tt  option to _q_s_u_b(1) for further details on
              array jobs).

              The task range specifier has the form _n[-_m[:_s]]. The  range  may
              be  a single number, a  simple range  of the form _n-_m or a range
              with a step size _s.

              Instead of _j_o_b_/_t_a_s_k___i_d___l_i_s_t it is possible to  use  the  keyword
              'all' to modify the hold state for all jobs of the current user.

EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTTAALL VVAARRIIAABBLLEESS
       SSGGEE__RROOOOTT       Specifies  the location of the Grid Engine standard con-
                      figuration files.

       SSGGEE__CCEELLLL       If set, specifies  the  default  Grid  Engine  cell.  To
                      address  a  Grid Engine cell _q_h_o_l_d uses (in the order of
                      precedence):

                             The name of the cell specified in the environment
                             variable SGE_CELL, if it is set.

                             The name of the default cell, i.e. ddeeffaauulltt.


       SSGGEE__DDEEBBUUGG__LLEEVVEELL
                      If set, specifies that debug information should be writ-
                      ten to stderr. In addition the level of detail in  which
                      debug information is generated is defined.

       SSGGEE__QQMMAASSTTEERR__PPOORRTT
                      If  set,  specifies the tcp port on which _s_g_e___q_m_a_s_t_e_r(8)
                      is expected to listen for communication requests.   Most
                      installations will use a services map entry for the ser-
                      vice "sge_qmaster" instead to define that port.
