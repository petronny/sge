       _q_h_o_s_t shows the current status of  the  available  Grid  Engine  hosts,
       queues and the jobs associated with the queues. Selection options allow
       you to get information about specific hosts, queues, jobs or users.  If
       multiple  selections are done a host is only displayed if all selection
       criteria for a host are met.  Without any options _q_h_o_s_t will display  a
       list of all hosts without queue or job information.

              _q_h_o_s_t  will  present  a detailed listing of the current resource
              availability per host with respect  to  all  resources  (if  the
              option  argument  is omitted) or with respect to those resources
              contained  in  the  resource_name  list.  Please  refer  to  the
              description  of  the FFuullll FFoorrmmaatt in section OOUUTTPPUUTT FFOORRMMAATTSS below
              for further detail.

       --hheellpp  Prints a listing of all options.

       --hh hhoosstt__lliisstt
              Prints a list of all hosts contained in host_list.

       --jj     Prints all jobs running on the queues hosted by the shown hosts.
              This switch calls --qq implicitly.

       --ll rreessoouurrccee[==vvaalluuee],...
              Defines the resources to be granted by the hosts which should be
              included in the host list output. Matching is performed on hosts
              based  on  non-mutable  resource  availability information only.
              That means load values are always ignored except  the  so-called
              static   load  values  (i.e.  "arch",  "num_proc",  "mem_total",
              "swap_total" and "virtual_total") ones. Also consumable utiliza-
              tion  is  ignored.   If  there are multiple -l resource requests
              they will be concatenated by a logical  AND:  a  host  needs  to
              match all resources to be displayed.

       --nnccbb   This  command line switch can be used in order to get 6.2u5 com-
              patible output with other _q_h_o_s_t(1)  command  line  switches.  In
              that  case the output of the corresponding command will suppress
              information concerning the execution host  topology.  Note  that
              this option will be removed in the next major version.

       --qq     Show  information  about the queues instances hosted by the dis-
              played hosts.

       --uu uusseerr,,......
              Display information only on those jobs and queues being  associ-
              ated with the users from the given user list.

       --xxmmll   This  option  can be used with all other options and changes the
              output to XML. The used schemas are referenced in the  XML  out-
              put. The output is printed to stdout.

              If  the --xxmmll parameter is combined with --nnccbb then the XML output
              will contain 6.2u5 compatible output.

       Depending on the presence or absence of the --qq  or  --FF  and  --jj  option
       three output formats need to be differentiated.

   DDeeffaauulltt FFoorrmmaatt ((wwiitthhoouutt --qq,, --FF aanndd --jj))
       For each host one line is printed. The output consists of consisting of

       +o  the Hostname

       +o  the Architecture.

       +o  the  Number of processors.

       +o  the Load.

       +o  the Total Memory.

       +o  the Used Memory.

       +o  the Total Swapspace.

       +o  the Used Swapspace.

       More  details  can  be  found  in  the  file _$_S_G_E___R_O_O_T_/_d_o_c_/_l_o_a_d___p_a_r_a_m_e_-
       _t_e_r_s_._a_s_c.

       If the --qq option is supplied, each host status line also contains extra
       lines for every queue hosted by the host consisting of,

       +o  the queue name.

       +o  the  queue  type  -  one of B(atch), I(nteractive), C(heckpointing),
          P(arallel), or combinations thereof,

       +o  the number of reserved (by advance reservation, not resource  reser-
          vation), used and, available job slots,

       +o  the  state  of  the  queue  -  one of u(nknown) if the corresponding
          _s_g_e___e_x_e_c_d(8) cannot be contacted, a(larm), A(larm),  C(alendar  sus-
          pended),   s(uspended),   S(ubordinate),   d(isabled),   D(isabled),
          E(rror), (c)configuration ambiguous, or combinations thereof.

       If the state is a(alarm) at least one of the load thresholds defined in
       the _l_o_a_d___t_h_r_e_s_h_o_l_d_s list of the queue configuration (see _q_u_e_u_e___c_o_n_f(5))
       is currently exceeded, which prevents from scheduling further  jobs  to
       that queue.

       As  opposed  to  this, the state A(larm) indicates that at least one of
       the suspend thresholds of the queue (see  _q_u_e_u_e___c_o_n_f(5))  is  currently
       exceeded.  This will result in jobs running in that queue being succes-
       sively suspended until no threshold is violated.

       The states s(uspended) and d(isabled) can be  assigned  to  queues  and
       released  via  the  _q_m_o_d(1)  command. Suspending a queue will cause all
       jobs executing in that queue to be suspended.

       The states D(isabled) and C(alendar suspended) indicate that the  queue
       has  been disabled or suspended automatically via the calendar facility
       of Grid Engine (see _c_a_l_e_n_d_a_r___c_o_n_f(5)), while  the  S(ubordinate)  state
       indicates, that the queue has been suspend via subordination to another
       queue (see _q_u_e_u_e___c_o_n_f(5) for details). When suspending a queue (regard-
       less of the cause) all jobs executing in that queue are suspended too.

       If an E(rror) state is displayed for a queue, _s_g_e___e_x_e_c_d(8) on that host
       was unable to locate the _s_g_e___s_h_e_p_h_e_r_d(8) executable  on  that  host  in
       order  to  start  a  job.  Please  check  the  error  logfile  of  that
       _s_g_e___e_x_e_c_d(8) for leads on how to resolve the problem. Please enable the
       queue afterwards via the --cc option of the _q_m_o_d(1) command manually.

       The  c(onfiguration  ambiguous) state indicates a problem with overlap-
       ping hosts groups (see _q_u_e_u_e___c_o_n_f(5)).  Use _q_s_t_a_t(1)'s  --eexxppllaaiinn  cc  to
       diagnose it.

       If the --FF option was used, resource availability information is printed
       following the host status line. For each resource (as  selected  in  an
       option  argument  to --FF or for all resources if the option argument was
       omitted) a single line is displayed with the following format:

       +o  a one letter  specifier  indicating  whether  the  current  resource
          availability value was dominated by either
          `gg' - a cluster global,
          `hh' - a host total or

       +o  a  second one letter specifier indicating the source for the current
          resource availability value, being one of
          `ll' - a load value reported for the resource,
          `LL' - a load value for the resource after administrator defined load
          scaling has been applied,
          `cc'  -  availability  derived from the consumable resources facility
          (see _c_o_m_p_l_e_x_e_s(5)),
          `ff' - a fixed availability definition derived from a  non-consumable
          complex attribute or a fixed resource limit.

       +o  after  a colon the name of the resource on which information is dis-
          played.

       +o  after an equal sign the current resource availability value.

       The displayed availability values  and  the  sources  from  which  they
       derive  are  always  the  minimum  values of all possible combinations.
       Hence, for example, a line of the form "qf:h_vmem=4G" indicates that  a
       queue currently has a maximum availability in virtual memory of 4 Giga-
       byte, where this value is a fixed value (e.g. a resource limit  in  the
       queue  configuration) and it is queue dominated, i.e. the host in total
       may have more virtual memory available than this, but the queue doesn't
       allow for more. Contrarily a line "hl:h_vmem=4G" would also indicate an
       upper bound of 4 Gigabyte virtual memory availability,  but  the  limit
       would  be derived from a load value currently reported for the host. So
       while the queue  might  allow  for  jobs  with  higher  virtual  memory
       requirements, the host on which this particular queue resides currently
       only has 4 Gigabyte available.

       After the queue status line (in case of --jj) a single  line  is  printed
       for each job running currently in this queue. Each job status line con-
       tains

       +o  the job ID,

       +o  the job name,

       +o  the job owner name,

       +o  the  status  of  the  job  -  one   of   t(ransfering),   r(unning),
          R(estarted),   s(uspended),  S(uspended)  or  T(hreshold)  (see  the
          RReedduucceedd FFoorrmmaatt section for detailed information),

       +o  the start date and time and the function of the job (MASTER or SLAVE
          - only meaningful in case of a parallel job) and

       +o  the priority of the jobs.

                      precedence):

                             The name of the cell specified in the environment
                             variable SGE_CELL, if it is set.

                      is expected to listen for communication requests.   Most
                      installations will use a services map entry for the ser-
                      vice "sge_qmaster" instead to define that port.
