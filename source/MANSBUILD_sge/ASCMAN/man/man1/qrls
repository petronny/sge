       _Q_r_l_s  provides a means for a user/operator/manager to release so called
       _h_o_l_d_s from one or more jobs pending to be scheduled for execution.   As
       long  as any type of hold is assigned to a job, the job is not eligible
       for scheduling.

       Holds can be assigned to jobs with the _q_h_o_l_d(1), _q_s_u_b(1)  or  the  _q_a_l_-
       _t_e_r(1) command.

       There are three different types of holds:

       uusseerr   User  holds  can  be assigned and removed by managers, operators
              and the owner of the jobs.

       ooppeerraattoorr
              Operator holds can be assigned and removed by managers and oper-
              ators.

       ssyysstteemm System holds can be assigned and removed by managers only.

       If  no  hold  type is specified with the --hh option (see below) the user
       hold is assumed by default.

       An alternate way to release holds is the _q_a_l_t_e_r(1) command (see the  _-_h
       option).

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       --hh {uu|oo|ss},...
              Releases a u(ser), o(perator) or s(system) hold or a combination
              thereof from one or more jobs.

       --hheellpp  Prints a listing of all options.

       --uu uusseerrnnaammee,,......
              Modifies the hold state of those jobs which  were  submitted  by
              users  specified in the list of usernames.  Managers are allowed
              to use the qqrrllss --uu ""**"" command to modify the hold state for jobs
              of all users.

              If a user uses the --uu switch, the user may specify an additional
              _j_o_b_/_t_a_s_k___i_d___l_i_s_t.

       jjoobb//ttaasskk__iidd__lliisstt
              Specified by the following form:

                  _j_o_b___i_d_[_._t_a_s_k___r_a_n_g_e_]_[_,_j_o_b___i_d_[_._t_a_s_k___r_a_n_g_e_]_,_._._._]

              If present, the _t_a_s_k___r_a_n_g_e restricts the effect of the operation
              to  the  array  job task range specified as suffix to the job id
              (see the --tt option to  _q_s_u_b(1)  for  further  details  on  array
              jobs).

              The  task  range specifier has the form n[-m[:s]]. The range may
              be a single number, a  simple range  of the form n-m or a  range
              with a step size.

              Instead  of  _j_o_b_/_t_a_s_k___i_d___l_i_s_t  it is possible to use the keyword
              'all' to modify all jobs of the current user.

EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTTAALL VVAARRIIAABBLLEESS
       SSGGEE__RROOOOTT       Specifies the location of the Grid Engine standard  con-
                      figuration files.

       SSGGEE__CCEELLLL       If  set,  specifies  the  default  Grid  Engine cell. To
                      address a Grid Engine cell _q_r_l_s uses (in  the  order  of
                      precedence):

                             The name of the cell specified in the environment
                             variable SGE_CELL, if it is set.

                             The name of the default cell, i.e. ddeeffaauulltt.


       SSGGEE__DDEEBBUUGG__LLEEVVEELL
                      If set, specifies that debug information should be writ-
                      ten  to stderr. In addition the level of detail in which
                      debug information is generated is defined.

       SSGGEE__QQMMAASSTTEERR__PPOORRTT
                      If set, specifies the tcp port on  which  _s_g_e___q_m_a_s_t_e_r(8)
                      is  expected to listen for communication requests.  Most
                      installations will use a services map entry for the ser-
                      vice "sge_qmaster" instead to define that port.
