       _Q_m_o_d enables users classified as _o_w_n_e_r_s (see _q_u_e_u_e___c_o_n_f(5) for details)
       of a workstation to modify the state of Grid Engine  queues  for  their
       machine as well as the state of their own jobs.  A manager/operator, or
       root, can execute _q_m_o_d for any queue and job in  a  cluster,  but  only
       from  administrative  hosts.   Find  additional  information concerning

              NNoottee:: Deprecated, may be removed in future release.  Please  use
              the --ccjj or --ccqq switch instead.
              Clears the error state of the specified jobs(s)/queue(s).

       --ccjj

       ----cclleeaarrjjoobb
              Clears the error state of the specified jobs(s).

       --ccqq

       ----cclleeaarrqquueeuuee
              Clears the error state of the specified queue(s).

       --dd

       ----ddiissaabbllee
              Disables  the  queue(s),  i.e. no further jobs are dispatched to
              disabled queues while jobs already executing in these queues are
              allowed to finish.

       --ee

       ----eennaabbllee
              Enables the queue(s).

       --ff

       ----ffoorrccee
              Force the modification action for the queue despite the apparent
              current state of the queue. For example if a queue appears to be
              suspended but the job execution seems to be continuing, the man-
              ager/operator can force a suspend operation on the jobs. In  any
              case,  the  queue  or  job  status  will  be  set,  even  if the
              _s_g_e___e_x_e_c_d(8) controlling  the  queues/jobs  cannot  be  reached.
              Requires manager/operator privileges.

       --hheellpp

       ----hheellpp Prints a listing of all options.

       --rr

              NNoottee::  Deprecated, may be removed in future release.  Please use
              the --rrjj or --rrqq switch instead.
              If applied to queues, reschedules all jobs currently running  in
              this  queue.   If applied to running jobs, reschedules the jobs.
              Requires root or manager privileges.  In order for a job  to  be
              rescheduled, it, or the queue in which it is executing must have
              the rerun flag activated.  (See -r option  in  the  _q_s_u_b(1)  man
              page and the _r_e_r_u_n option in the _q_u_e_u_e___c_o_n_f(5) man page for more
              information.)  Additional restrictions apply  for  parallel  and
              checkpointing  jobs.  (See the _r_e_s_c_h_e_d_u_l_e___u_n_k_n_o_w_n description in
              the _s_g_e___c_o_n_f(5) man page for details).

       --rrjj

       ----rreesscchheedduulleejjoobb
              If applied to running jobs, reschedules the jobs. Requires  root
              or manager privileges.

       --rrqq

       ----rreesscchheedduulleeqquueeuuee
              Reschedules  all jobs currently running in the specified queues.
              Requires root or manager privileges.

              NNoottee:: Deprecated, may be removed in future release.  Please  use
              the --ssjj or --ssqq switch instead.
              If  applied  to  queues,  suspends the queues and any jobs which
              might be active in them. If applied to  running  jobs,  suspends
              the jobs.

       --ssjj

       ----ssuussppeennddjjoobb
              If  applied to running jobs, suspends the jobs. If a job is both
              suspended explicitly and via suspension of its queue,  a  subse-
              quent  unsuspend  of  the  queue will not release the suspension
              state on the job.

       --ssqq

       ----ssuussppeennddqquueeuuee
              Suspends the specified queues and any jobs which might be active
              in them.

       --uuss

       ----uunnssuussppeenndd
              NNoottee::  Deprecated, may be removed in future release.  Please use
              the --uussjj or --uussqq switch instead.
              If applied to queues, unsuspends the queues and any  jobs  which
              might  be  active  in  them.  If applied to jobs, unsuspends the
              jobs.

       --uussjj

       ----uunnssuussppeennddjjoobb
              Unsuspends the specified  jobs.  If  a  job  is  both  suspended
              explicitly  and via suspension of its queue, a subsequent unsus-
              pend of the queue will not release the suspension state  on  the
              job.

       --uussqq

       ----uunnssuussppeennddqquueeuuee
              Unsuspends  the  specified  queues  and  any jobs which might be
              active in them.

       SSGGEE__RROOOOTT       Specifies the location of the Grid Engine standard  con-
                      figuration files.

       SSGGEE__CCEELLLL       If  set,  specifies  the  default  Grid  Engine cell. To
                      address a Grid Engine cell _q_m_o_d uses (in  the  order  of
                      precedence):

                             The name of the cell specified in the environment
                             variable SGE_CELL, if it is set.

                             The name of the default cell, i.e. ddeeffaauulltt.

                      If set, specifies that debug information should be writ-
                      ten  to stderr. In addition the level of detail in which
                      debug information is generated is defined.

       SSGGEE__QQMMAASSTTEERR__PPOORRTT
                      If set, specifies the tcp port on  which  _s_g_e___q_m_a_s_t_e_r(8)
                      is  expected to listen for communication requests.  Most
                      installations will use a services map entry for the ser-
                      vice "sge_qmaster" instead to define that port.
