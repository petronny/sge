DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       The  _q_a_c_c_t  utility  scans the accounting data file (see _a_c_c_o_u_n_t_i_n_g(5))
       and produces a summary of information for wall-clock  time,  CPU  time,
       and  system  time  for  the  categories of host name, queue name, group
       name, owner name, job name, job ID, and  for  the  queues  meeting  the
       resource requirements as specified with the --ll switch.  Combinations of
       each category are permitted. Alternatively, all or specific jobs can be
       listed  with  the  --jj  switch.   For  example the search criteria could
       include summarizing for a queue and an owner, but not for two queues in
       the same request.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       --aarr [aarr__iidd]
              The ID of the advance reservation for which usage is summarized.
              If aarr__iidd is not given,  accounting  data  are  listed  for  each
              advance reservation separately.

       --AA AAccccoouunntt
              The account for jobs to be summarized.

       --bb BBeeggiinnTTiimmee
              The earliest start time for jobs to be summarized, in the format
              [[CC]YY]MMDDhhmm[.SS]. See also the --dd  option.  If  CC  is  not
              specified, a YY of < 70 means 20YY.

       --dd DDaayyss
              The  number  of days for which to summarize and print accounting
              information. If used together with the --bb _B_e_g_i_n_T_i_m_e ooppttiioonn  ((sseeee

       --ee EEnnddTTiimmee
              The  latest  start time for jobs to be summarized, in the format
              [[CC]YY]MMDDhhmm[.SS]. See also --dd option. If CC is  not  speci-
              fied, a YY of < 70 means 20YY.

       [--ff AAccccttFFiilleeNNaammee]
              The  accounting  file to be used. If omitted, the system default
              accounting file is processed.

       --gg [GGrroouuppIIdd|GGrroouuppNNaammee]
              The numeric system group id or the group  alphanumeric  name  of
              the   job   owners   to   be  included  in  the  accounting.  If
              GGrroouuppIIdd/GGrroouuppNNaammee is omitted, all groups are accounted.

       --hh [HHoossttNNaammee]
              The case-insensitive name of  the  host  upon  which  accounting
              information  is  requested.  If  the name is omitted, totals for
              each host are listed separately.

       --hheellpp  Display help information for the _q_a_c_c_t command.

       --jj [jjoobb__iidd||jjoobb__nnaammee||ppaatttteerrnn]
              The name, an expression for matching names, or  ID  of  the  job
              during execution for which accounting information is printed. If
              neither a name nor an ID is given, all jobs are listed.
              This option changes the output format of  _q_a_c_c_t.  If  activated,
              CPU  times  are  no  longer accumulated but the "raw" accounting
              information  is  printed  in  a  formatted  form  instead.   See
              _a_c_c_o_u_n_t_i_n_g(5) for an explanation of the displayed information.

       --ll aattttrr==vvaall,,......
              A  resource  requirement  specification which must be met by the
              queues in which the jobs being  accounted  were  executing.  The
              resource  request  is  very  similar  to  the  one  described in
              _q_s_u_b(1).

       --oo [OOwwnneerr]
              The name of the owner of the jobs for which  accounting  statis-
              tics are assembled. If the optional OOwwnneerr argument is omitted, a
              listing of the accounting statistics of all job  owners  present
              in the accounting file is produced.

       --ppee [PPEEnnaammee]
              The  name  of the parallel environment for which usage is summa-
              rized.  If PPEEnnaammee is not given, accounting data are  listed  for
              each parallel environment separately.

       --qq [wwcc__qquueeuuee__nnaammee]
              An  expression  for  queues  for  which usage is summarized. All
              queue instances matching the expression will be  listed.  If  no
              expression is specified, a cluster queue summary will be given.

       --sslloottss [SSlloottNNuummbbeerr]
              The  number  of  queue  slots for which usage is summarized.  If
              SSlloottNNuummbbeerr is not given, accounting data  are  listed  for  each
              number of queue slots separately.

       --tt ttaasskk__iidd__rraannggee__lliisstt
              Only available together with the --jj option described above.

              The  --tt  switch  specifies  the  array job task range, for which
              accounting information should be printed. Syntax  and  semantics
              of  ttaasskk__iidd__rraannggee__lliisstt are identical to that one described under
              the --tt option to _q_s_u_b(1).  Please see  there  also  for  further
              information on array jobs.

       --PP [PPrroojjeecctt
              The  name  of  the  project  for  which usage is summarized.  If
              PPrroojjeecctt is not given, accounting data are listed for each  rele-
              vant project separately.

       --DD [DDeeppaarrttmmeenntt]
              The  name  of  the department for which usage is summarized.  If
              DDeeppaarrttmmeenntt is not given, accounting data  are  listed  for  each
              relevant department separately.

EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTTAALL VVAARRIIAABBLLEESS
       SSGGEE__RROOOOTT       Specifies  the location of the Grid Engine standard con-
                      figuration files.

       SSGGEE__CCEELLLL       If set, specifies  the  default  Grid  Engine  cell.  To
                      address  a  Grid Engine cell _q_a_c_c_t uses (in the order of
                      precedence):

                             The name of the cell specified in the environment
                             variable SGE_CELL, if it is set.

                             The name of the default cell, i.e. ddeeffaauulltt.


       SSGGEE__DDEEBBUUGG__LLEEVVEELL
                      If set, specifies that debug information should be writ-
                      ten to stderr. In addition the level of detail in  which
                      debug information is generated is defined.

       SSGGEE__QQMMAASSTTEERR__PPOORRTT
                      If  set,  specifies the tcp port on which _s_g_e___q_m_a_s_t_e_r(8)
                      is expected to listen for communication requests.   Most
                      installations will use a services map entry for the ser-
                      vice "sge_qmaster" instead to define that port.

       SSGGEE__EEXXEECCDD__PPOORRTT If set, specifies the tcp port on which _s_g_e___e_x_e_c_d(8)  is
                      expected  to  listen  for  communication requests.  Most
                      installations will use a services map entry for the ser-
                      vice "sge_execd" instead to define that port.
