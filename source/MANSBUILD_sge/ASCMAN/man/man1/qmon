DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       _Q_m_o_n allows administrators and users to manipulate the Grid Engine sys-
       tem from an X-Window  environment.   _Q_m_o_n  provides  various  dialogues
       linked  together  in  multiple  ways.  For each task the user wishes to
       accomplish via _q_m_o_n a corresponding dialogue  is  provided.  There  are
       multiple ways to address the proper dialogue for a certain task:

       +o  The  _q_m_o_n  main window that comes up first on start-up contains icon
          buttons for all major administrative and user tasks. A functionality
          tooltip is displayed when pointing at the different icons.

       +o  A  TTaasskk  pulldown  menu  button appears in the _q_m_o_n main window menu
          bar. Clicking on it opens a list of available tasks.  Selecting  one
          of them opens the corresponding dialogue.

       +o  The  TTaasskk pulldown menu also contains the key accelerators which can
          be used to invoke the task dialogues directly from the  main  window
          by pressing a certain sequence on the keyboard.

       +o  While  navigating  through  a certain dialogue and its dialogue sub-
          hierarchy, links to other  dialogues  occur  whenever  a  connection
          between both dialogues is obvious. Pushing the buttons that identify
          the links opens up the other dialogues.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       The supported options are the standard X Toolkit options  as  described
       in _X(1) section OOppttiioonnss. Furthermore, _q_m_o_n supports:

       --ccmmaapp  Installs a private color map for _q_m_o_n.  This is sometimes useful
              if other applications have already allocated lots of colors  and
              if  _q_m_o_n,  therefore  prints corresponding error messages. NNoottee,
              however, that using a private color map will result in color map
              switches whenever you enter or leave _q_m_o_n windows.

       --ffoonnttFFaammiillyy {{bbiigg||mmeeddiiuumm||ssmmaallll}}
              Notifies  _q_m_o_n to use different size font families for different
              resolution sizes.

       --hheellpp  Displays usage information.

   JJoobb CCoonnttrrooll
       The JJoobb CCoonnttrrooll dialogue provides a folder of tabulated  lists  of  the
       still  pending  jobs,  already running jobs and recently finished jobs.
       The dialogue allows for detailed information on the jobs as well as for
       the  deletion  and  suspension of jobs being selected.  In addition the
       job control dialogue offers links to the SSuubbmmiitt dialogue  in  order  to
       submit  new  jobs  or to change attributes of pending jobs (QQaalltteerr but-
       ton). The fields displayed in the tabular display  and  the  jobs  dis-
       played  can  be  customized by pressing the CCuussttoommiizzee button. This cus-
       tomization can be saved to the _~_/_._q_m_o_n___p_r_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e_s file and is used  on
       following startup for the initial configuration of the JJoobb CCoonnttrrooll dia-
       logue.


   QQuueeuuee CCoonnttrrooll
       The QQuueeuuee CCoonnttrrooll dialogue with its sub-dialogue hierarchy enables  the
       user  to  control the status of the Grid Engine queues actually config-
       ured in the system and allows the administrator to add new queues or to
       modify  or  delete  existing  ones.  The QQuueeuuee CCoonnttrrooll dialogue shows a
       tabbed view of Cluster Queues or their corresponding Queue Instances in
       a tabular way.

       By  pushing the AAdddd, CClloonnee or MMooddiiffyy button, a sub-dialogue for config-
       uring Grid Engine queues is opened.  A queue needs to  be  selected  to
       use  the  clone  and  modify  operation. The configuration sub-dialogue
       allows for definition of the queue and its attributes.  The  configura-
       tion  sub-dialogue  contains  in the upper section the queue name and a
       list of hosts or hostgroups for which this queue contains the  configu-
       ration.   The  lower  section contains a list of hosts or hostgroups at
       the left, where the default attributes are shown when the "@/" entry is
       highlighted.   These default attributes can be overruled on a hostgroup
       or host basis by enabling attributes and changing  their  values  after
       this  hostgroup  or  host  entry  has been added in the "Attributes for
       Host/Hostgroup"  listbox.   The  queue  configuration  parameters  (see
       _q_u_e_u_e___c_o_n_f(5))  are  subdivided into different categories (GGeenneerraall CCoonn--

       tomized  in  a  similar  way  as the JJoobb CCoonnttrrooll dialogue. The settings
       applied here are also saved in _~_/_._q_m_o_n___p_r_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e_s.

   SSuubbmmiitt
       The JJoobb SSuubbmmiissssiioonn dialogue serves for submitting batch and interactive
       jobs  and is also invoked when changing attributes of pending jobs from
       the JJoobb CCoonnttrrooll dialogue explained above  (QQaalltteerr  button).  To  toggle
       between  batch  and  interactive  jobs please use the BBaattcchh//IInntteerraaccttiivvee
       button at the top of the button column on the right  side  of  the  JJoobb
       SSuubbmmiissssiioonn screen.

       The  dialogue  consists of a folder containing two job preparation dia-
       logue pages. The most frequently used parameters in the course of a job
       submission  are  offered  on  the  GGeenneerraall page. A job script has to be
       defined; all other fields are optional. If the job  demands  specifica-
       tion  of  advanced requirements, the AAddvvaanncceedd tab can be used to switch
       to an enhanced parameter display.

       If resource  requirements  are  mandatory  for  the  job,  the  RReeqquueesstt
       RReessoouurrcceess  icon button has to be used to pop up the RReeqquueesstteedd RReessoouurrcceess
       sub-dialogue.  This sub-dialogue allows for selection of  the  required
       resources of the job and for definition of the quantities in which this
       resources are to be provided. The AAvvaaiillaabbllee RReessoouurrcceess  are  constituted
       from  those complex attributes declared _r_e_q_u_e_s_t_a_b_l_e (see _c_o_m_p_l_e_x(5) for
       details). Resource requirements can be made HHaarrdd, i.e. they must be met
       before  a job can be started in a queue, or SSoofftt, i.e. they are granted
       on an as-available basis.

       Closing the RReeqquueesstteedd RReessoouurrcceess sub-dialogue with the done button books
       the specified requirement for the job. Pushing the SSuubbmmiitt button on the
       top level SSuubbmmiitt dialogue submits the job.

   CCoommpplleexx CCoonnffiigg
       The  CCoommpplleexx  CCoonnffiigg  allows  the  administrator  to  add  new  complex
       attributes  or to modify or delete existing ones (see _c_o_m_p_l_e_x(5)).  The
       complex configuration dialogue provides a tabulated list of the complex
       attribute  entries  and  an  input region for the declaration of new or
       modified entries. The AAdddd button updates the tabulated list with a  new
       attribute.   The  MMooddiiffyy  button  changes a highlighted existing entry.
       The DDeelleettee button removes the highlighted  attributes.   The  LLooaadd  aanndd
       SSaavvee  buttons  allow saving or reloading the whole attribute list to or
       from file.  The OOkk button registers the additional or modified  complex
       attributes with _s_g_e___q_m_a_s_t_e_r(8).

   HHoosstt CCoonnffiigg
       Four  types of host related lists can be maintained via the HHoosstt CCoonnffiigg
       dialogue:

              Administration Hosts
              Submit Hosts
              Host Groups
              Execution Hosts

       The host list to be manipulated is selected via clicking at one of  the
       tabs  named  correspondingly. The first two host lists only provide for
       adding or deleting entries, thereby allowing administrative  or  submit
       permission  for the hosts on the lists, or denying it otherwise respec-
       tively.  The host group list allows the manipulation  of  host  groups.
       Host  groups can reference either other host groups or hosts.  The exe-
       cution host list entries in addition  provide  the  ability  to  define
       scaling factors for the load sensors, consumable complex attributes and
       access  attributes  (access,  xaccess  and  projects,   xprojects)   as
       described  in  _c_o_m_p_l_e_x(5).  CPU, memory and I/O usage reported for run-
       ning jobs can be scaled in addition and the relative performance  of  a
       host   can   be  defined  with  the  RReessoouurrccee  CCaappaabbiilliittyy  FFaaccttoorr  (see
       _h_o_s_t___c_o_n_f(5)).

   CClluusstteerr CCoonnffiigg
       This dialogue maintains the cluster global  configuration  as  well  as
       host specific derivatives (see _s_g_e___c_o_n_f(5)).  When opened, the dialogue
       displays a selection list for all  hosts  which  have  a  configuration
       assigned.  The  special name "global" refers to the cluster global con-
       figuration. By pushing the AAdddd//MMooddiiffyy button a sub-dialogue is  opened,
       which  allows  for  modification of the cluster configuration. For host
       specific configurations the 'global' host specific configuration fields
       are set insensitive and only the allowed parameters can be manipulated.

   SScchheedduulleerr CCoonnffiigg
       The  SScchheedduulleerr  CCoonnffiigguurraattiioonn dialogue provides the means to change the
       behavior of the Grid Engine scheduler  thread  part  of  _s_g_e___q_m_a_s_t_e_r(8)
       process.  The dialogue contains a representation for all scheduler con-
       figuration parameters as described in _s_c_h_e_d___c_o_n_f(5).  It is  subdivided
       in  the two sections GGeenneerraall PPaarraammeetteerrss and LLooaadd AAddjjuussttmmeennttss, which can
       be selected via the corresponding tabs.  The OOkk  button  registers  any
       changes with _s_g_e___q_m_a_s_t_e_r(8).

   CCaalleennddaarr CCoonnffiigg
       The CCaalleennddaarr CCoonnffiigg allows the administrator to add new calendars or to
       modify or delete existing ones (see  _c_a_l_e_n_d_a_r___c_o_n_f(5)).   The  dialogue
       offers  a  selection  list  for the existing calendars and displays the
       configuration of the one being selected. By pushing the DDeelleettee  button,
       the  selected  calendar  is deleted from the configuration. Pushing the
       AAdddd/MMooddiiffyy button will open a calendar  configuration  dialogue,  which
       allows  to  create  new calendars or which provides the means to change
       the existing ones. The OOkk button registers the additional  or  modified
       calendar with _s_g_e___q_m_a_s_t_e_r(8).

   UUsseerr CCoonnffiigg
       User  permissions are controlled via the UUsseerr CCoonnffiigg dialogue.  The tab
       widget in the left section of the dialogue allows for selecting between

              Configuration of MMaannaaggeerr accounts.
              Configuration of OOppeerraattoorr accounts.
              Definition of UUsseerrsseettss.
              Definition of UUsseerr accounts.

       Those user accounts added to the list of manager or  operator  accounts
       are  given permission to act as managers or operators respectively when
       accessing Grid Engine under their own account.

       The userset lists are used together with the uusseerr__lliissttss and xxuusseerr__lliissttss
       host,   queue,   project  and  cluster  configuration  parameters  (see
       _q_u_e_u_e___c_o_n_f(5), _p_r_o_j_e_c_t(5) and _s_g_e___c_o_n_f(5)) to control access  of  users
       to hosts, queues, projects and the entire cluster.  A userset is just a
       collection of user names and UNIX group names. Group names are  identi-
       fied  by  prefixing  them with a "@" sign. The already-defined usersets
       are displayed in a selection list. These lists can be modified, and new
       lists can be created, using the UUsseerrsseett definition dialogue.

       Usersets  can  be used as AAcccceessss LLiisstt and/or as DDeeppaarrttmmeenntt required for
       the so called FFuunnccttiioonnaall PPoolliiccyy and OOvveerrrriiddee PPoolliiccyy (see TTiicckkeett  CCoonnffiigg
       below).

       User  names  can  be  added to the system as entries to the Grid Engine
       user database (see _u_s_e_r(5)); here a default project can be attached  to
       the user too.  This can be done with the UUsseerr sub-dialogue.

       The TTiicckkeettss button in the button list on the right side of the dialogue
       opens the TTiicckkeett CCoonnffiigg dialogue (see below).

   PPEE CCoonnffiigg
       Parallel environment (PE) interfaces can be configured with  this  dia-
       logue.   PE  interfaces are necessary to describe how parallel program-
       ming environments like PVM (Parallel  Virtual  Machine),  MPI  (Message
       Passing  Interface),  or  shared  memory  parallel  systems,  are to be
       instantiated and to impose access restrictions onto the PEs.  When  the
       dialogue  is opened a list of the configured PEs is displayed, together
       with the current configuration  (see  _s_g_e___p_e(5))  of  the  selected  PE
       interface.   To  add  new PE interfaces, or to modify existing ones, an
       AAdddd and a MMooddiiffyy button are available which open a PE interface config-
       uration sub-dialogue. After applying the changes and quitting this sub-
       dialogue with the OOKK button, the new or modified PE interface is regis-
       tered with _s_g_e___q_m_a_s_t_e_r(8).

   CChheecckkppooiinntt CCoonnffiigg
       Checkpointing  environment  interfaces can be configured with this dia-
       logue.   Checkpointing  environments  are  necessary  to  describe  the
       attributes  which the different checkpointing methods and their deriva-
       tives on various operating system platforms supported  by  Grid  Engine
       have.  When  the  dialogue  is  opened a list of the already configured
       checkpointing environments is displayed together with the current  con-
       figuration  (see  _c_h_e_c_k_p_o_i_n_t(5)) of the selected checkpointing environ-
       ment. To add new checkpointing  environments,  or  to  modify  existing
       ones, an AAdddd and a MMooddiiffyy button is available which opens a checkpoint-
       ing environment configuration sub-dialogue. After applying the  changes
       and  quitting this sub-dialogue with the OOKK button, the new or modified
       checkpointing environment is registered with _s_g_e___q_m_a_s_t_e_r(8).

   TTiicckkeett CCoonnff
       This dialogue offers an overview  and  editing  screen  for  allocating
       tickets  to  the  share-based, functional and override scheduling poli-
       cies.

       The DDeeaaddlliinnee JJoobb button opens  the  UUsseerr  CCoonnff  dialogue  box.   Please
       change  to the Userset sub-dialogue and select the userset named "dead-
       lineusers".  Only users of this userset may submit deadline jobs.

       The SShhaarree TTrreeee PPoolliiccyy button opens the dialogue for creating and  edit-
       ing  the  Grid  Engine share tree (see _s_h_a_r_e___t_r_e_e(5) and _s_c_h_e_d_d___c_o_n_f(5)
       for a description of the configuration parameters).

       The FFuunnccttiioonnaall PPoolliiccyy button opens the dialogue for creating and  edit-
       ing  the  allocation  of  the  functional  shares  (see  _s_c_h_e_d___c_o_n_f(5),
       _a_c_c_e_s_s___l_i_s_t(5), _p_r_o_j_e_c_t(5), _q_u_e_u_e___c_o_n_f(5) and _u_s_e_r(5) for a description
       of  the  different  types  of  functional  shares  and the configurable
       weighting parameters).

       The OOvveerrrriiddee PPoolliiccyy button opens the dialogue for creating and  editing
       the  allocation  of  override  tickets (see _a_c_c_e_s_s___l_i_s_t(5), _p_r_o_j_e_c_t(5),
       _q_u_e_u_e___c_o_n_f(5) and _u_s_e_r(5) for a description of the different  types  of
       override tickets).

   PPrroojjeecctt CCoonnff
       This button opens a dialog for creating projects.
       The dialogue offers a selection list for the existing projects and dis-
       plays the configuration of the  one  being  selected.  By  pushing  the
       DDeelleettee  button, the selected project is deleted from the configuration.
       Pushing the AAdddd/MMooddiiffyy button will open a  project  configuration  dia-
       logue,  which  allows  creating  new  projects  changing existing ones.
       Project configuration in essence means giving or denying  access  to  a
       project  for usersets (see UUsseerr CCoonnff above as well as _p_r_o_j_e_c_t(5)).  The
       Ok button registers the additional or modified project  with  _s_g_e___q_m_a_s_-
       _t_e_r(8).

   BBrroowwsseerr
       The  OObbjjeecctt  BBrroowwsseerr dialogue's purpose is manifold: First of all, Grid
       Engine and _q_m_o_n Messages, such as notification of error or success con-
       cerning  a  previously taken action, can be displayed in the dialogue's
       output window.  Also the standard output and the standard error  output
       of _q_m_o_n can be diverted to the OObbjjeecctt BBrroowwsseerr output window.

       Additionally  the  OObbjjeecctt  BBrroowwsseerr  can  be  used to display continuous
       information about Grid Engine objects as the mouse pointer  moves  over
       their representation as icons or table entries in other _q_m_o_n dialogues.
       Currently, only the display of the configuration  of  two  Grid  Engine
       objects in two separate dialogues is supported:

       +o  Queue  configurations  are  displayed  as  soon as the mouse pointer
          enters a queue icon in the top level  QQuueeuuee  CCoonnttrrooll  dialogue  (see
          above).  This  facility  is activated by pushing the QQuueeuuee button in
          the OObbjjeecctt BBrroowwsseerr dialogue.

       +o  Detailed job information is printed as soon as the  user  moves  the
          mouse  pointer  over  a line in the JJoobb CCoonnttrrooll dialogue (see above)
          assigned to a running or pending job.

       +o  Additionally job scheduling information is displayed in the  browser
          if  the  WWhhyy?? button in the JJoobb CCoonnttrrooll dialogue is pressed. In this
          case the Browser dialogue is opened implicitly  and  any  scheduling
          related information is displayed.

   EExxiitt
       The EExxiitt icon button is not linked with a dialogue. Its sole purpose is
       to close all active _q_m_o_n dialogues and to exit the application.

       The available resources, their meaning and the syntax to be followed in
       order  to  modify  them are described in the default _q_m_o_n resource file
       (see the section FFiilleess below for the location of the resource file).

EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTTAALL VVAARRIIAABBLLEESS
       SSGGEE__RROOOOTT       Specifies the location of the Grid Engine standard  con-
                      figuration files.

       SSGGEE__CCEELLLL       If  set,  specifies  the  default  Grid  Engine cell. To
                      address a Grid Engine cell _q_m_o_n uses (in  the  order  of
                      precedence):

                             The name of the cell specified in the environment
                             variable SGE_CELL, if it is set.

                             The name of the default cell, i.e. ddeeffaauulltt.


       SSGGEE__DDEEBBUUGG__LLEEVVEELL
                      If set, specifies that debug information should be writ-
                      ten  to stderr. In addition the level of detail in which
                      debug information is generated is defined.

       SSGGEE__QQMMAASSTTEERR__PPOORRTT
                      If set, specifies the tcp port on  which  _s_g_e___q_m_a_s_t_e_r(8)
                      is  expected to listen for communication requests.  Most
                      installations will use a services map entry  instead  to
                      define that port.

       If the line to be entered in an editing window is longer than the width
       of the window, then the text just runs off the end of the window.
