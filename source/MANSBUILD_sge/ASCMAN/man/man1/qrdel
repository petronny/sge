       _Q_r_d_e_l  provides  a  means  for a user/operator/manager to delete one or
       more Advance Reservations  (AR).  A  manager/operator  can  delete  ARs
       belonging  to any user, while a regular user can only delete his or her
       own ARs.  If a manager wants to delete another user's AR,  the  manager
       can specify the AR id.  By default, "qrdel wc_ar_name" will delete only
       the ARs belonging to that user. A manager is  able  to  delete  another
       user's  AR  via  "-u wc_user_list".  Jobs referring to an AR tagged for
       deletion will also be removed.  Only if all jobs referring to an AR are
       removed from the Grid Engine database will the AR also be removed.

       _Q_r_d_e_l  deletes  ARs  in  the order in which the AR identifiers are pre-
       sented.  Find  additional  information  concerning   _w_c___u_s_e_r___l_i_s_t   and
       _w_c___a_r___l_i_s_t in _s_g_e___t_y_p_e_s(1).

       --ff     Force  action  for  AR.  The  AR  and  the jobs using the AR are
              deleted  from  the  Grid  Engine  queuing  system  even  if  the
              _s_g_e___e_x_e_c_d(8)  controlling  the  AR  jobs does not respond to the
              delete request sent by the _s_g_e___q_m_a_s_t_e_r(8).
              Users which have neither Grid Engine manager nor operator status
              can only use the --ff option for their own ARs.

       --hheellpp  Prints a list of all options.

       --uu wwcc__uusseerr__lliisstt
              Deletes  only  those ARs which were submitted by users specified
              in the list of usernames.  For managers, it is possible  to  use
              qqrrddeell --uu ""**"" to delete all ARs for all users. If a manager wants
              to delete a specific AR for a user, he has to specify  the  user
              and  the AR id. If no AR is specified, all ARs belonging to that
              user are deleted.

       wwcc__aarr__lliisstt
              A list of AR id's that should be deleted

       SSGGEE__RROOOOTT       Specifies the location of the Grid Engine standard  con-
                      figuration files.

       SSGGEE__CCEELLLL       If  set,  specifies  the  default  Grid  Engine cell. To
                      address a Grid Engine cell _q_r_d_e_l uses (in the  order  of
                      precedence):

                             The name of the cell specified in the environment
                             variable SGE_CELL, if it is set.

                             The name of the default cell, i.e. ddeeffaauulltt.

                      If set, specifies that debug information should be writ-
                      ten  to stderr. In addition the level of detail in which
                      debug information is generated is defined.

       SSGGEE__QQMMAASSTTEERR__PPOORRTT
                      If set, specifies the tcp port on  which  the  _s_g_e___q_m_a_s_-
                      _t_e_r(8) is expected to listen for communication requests.
                      Most installations will use a service map entry for  the
                      service "sge_qmaster" instead of defining the port.
