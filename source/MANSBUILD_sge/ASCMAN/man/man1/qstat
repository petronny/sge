       _q_s_t_a_t  shows the current status of the available Grid Engine queues and
       the jobs associated with the queues. Selection options allow you to get
       information  about  specific jobs, queues or users.  If multiple selec-
       tions are done, a queue is only displayed if all selection criteria for
       a queue instance are met.  Without any option _q_s_t_a_t will display only a
       list of jobs, with no queue status information.

       The administrator and the user may  define  files  (see  _s_g_e___q_s_t_a_t(5)),
       which  can  contain  any of the options described below. A cluster-wide
       sge_qstat  file   may   be    placed   under   $SGE_ROOT/$SGE_CELL/com-
       mon/sge_qstat.   The  user private file is searched for at the location
       $HOME/.sge_qstat.  The home directory request file  has  higher  prece-
       dence  than  the  cluster global file.  The command line can be used to
       override the flags contained in the files.

       --eexxppllaaiinn aa||AA||cc||EE
              'c' displays the reason for the c(onfiguration ambiguous)  state
              of  a  queue instance. 'a' shows the reason for the alarm state.
              Suspend alarm state reasons will be displayed by 'A'.  'E'  dis-
              plays the reason for a queue instance error state.

              The  output format for the alarm reasons is one line per reason,
              containing the resource value and threshold. For  details  about
              the  resource  value please refer to the description of the FFuullll
              FFoorrmmaatt in section OOUUTTPPUUTT FFOORRMMAATTSS below.

       --eexxtt   Displays additional information for each job related to the  job
              ticket policy scheme (see OUTPUT FORMATS below).

       --ff     Specifies a "full" format display of information.  The --ff option
              causes summary information on all queues to be  displayed  along
              with the queued job list.

       --FF [ rreessoouurrccee__nnaammee,,...... ]
              As  for  --ff,  information  is  displayed  on all jobs as well as
              queues. In addition, _q_s_t_a_t will present a  detailed  listing  of
              the  current resource availability per queue with respect to all
              resources (if the option argument is omitted) or with respect to
              those  resources  contained  in  the  resource_name list. Please
              refer to the description of the FFuullll FFoorrmmaatt  in  section  OOUUTTPPUUTT
              FFOORRMMAATTSS below for further detail.

       --gg {{cc||dd||tt}}[[++]]
              The  --gg  option  allows  for  controlling  grouping of displayed
              objects.

              With --gg cc a cluster  queue  summary  is  displayed.  Find   more
              information in the section OOUUTTPPUUTT FFOORRMMAATTSS.

              With  --gg  dd array jobs are displayed verbosely in a one line per
              job task fashion. By default, array jobs  are  grouped  and  all
              tasks  with  the  same  status (for pending tasks only) are dis-
              played in a single line. The array job task id  range  field  in
              the  output  (see  section  OOUUTTPPUUTT FFOORRMMAATTSS) specifies the corre-
              sponding set of tasks.

              With --gg tt parallel jobs are displayed verbosely in  a  one  line
              per  parallel  job task fashion. By  default, parallel job tasks
              are displayed in a single line. Also with --gg tt option the  func-
              tion  of  each  parallel  task is displayed rather than the jobs
              slot amount (see section OOUUTTPPUUTT FFOORRMMAATTSS).


       --hheellpp  Prints a listing of all options.

       --jj [[jjoobb__lliisstt]]
              Prints either for all pending jobs  or  the  jobs  contained  in
              job_list  various information. The job_list can contain job_ids,
              job_names, or wildcard expression _s_g_e___t_y_p_e_s(1).

              For jobs in E(rror) state the error  reason  is  displayed.  For
              jobs  that could not be dispatched during in the last scheduling
              interval  the  obstacles  are  shown,  if  'schedd_job_info'  in
              _s_c_h_e_d___c_o_n_f(5) is configured accordingly.

              For  running  jobs available information on resource utilization
              is shown about consumed cpu time  in  seconds,  integral  memory
              usage in Gbytes seconds, amount of data transferred in io opera-
              tions, current virtual memory utilization in Mbytes, and maximum
              virtual  memory  utilization  in Mbytes. This information is not
              available if resource utilization retrieval is not supported for
              the OS platform where the job is hosted.

              In  combination  with  --ccpp the output of this command will addi-
              tionally contain the information of  a  requested  binding  (see
              --bbiinnddiinngg  of  _q_s_u_b(1)) and the changes that have been applied to
              the topology string (real binding) for the host where  this  job
              is running.

              The  topology  string will contain capital letters for all those
              cores that were not bound to the displayed job. Bound cores will
              be  shown  lowercase  (E.g "SCCcCSCCcC" means that core 2 on the
              two available sockets where bound to this job).

              Please refer to the file <sge_root>/doc/load_parameters.asc  for
              detailed information on the standard set of load values.

       --ll rreessoouurrccee[==vvaalluuee],...
              Defines  the  resources  required  by the jobs or granted by the
              queues on which information is requested. Matching is  performed
              on queues based on non-mutable resource availability information
              only. That means load values are always ignored except  the  so-
              called static load values (i.e. "arch", "num_proc", "mem_total",
              "swap_total" and  "virtual_total").  Consumable  utilization  is
              also  ignored.   The  pending  jobs  are restricted to jobs that
              might run in one of the above queues. In a similar fashion  also
              the queue-job matching bases only on non-mutable resource avail-
              ability information.  If there are multiple -l resource requests
              they  will  be  concatenated  by a logical AND: a queue needs to
              match all resources to be displayed.

       --nnee    In combination with --ff the  option  suppresses  the  display  of
              empty  queues.  This means all queues where actually no jobs are
              running are not displayed.

       --nnccbb   In combination with --nnccbb the output of a command  will  suppress
              information  of  a  requested binding and changes that have been
              applied to the topology string (real binding) for the host where
              the job is running.  This information will disappear in combina-
              tion with the parameters --rr and --jj.

              Please note that this command line switch is intended to provide
              backward  compatibility  and  will  be removed in the next major
              release.

       --ppee ppee__nnaammee,,......
              Displays status information with respect  to  queues  which  are
              attached  to at least one of the parallel environments listed in
              the comma-separated option argument. Status information for jobs
              is  displayed  either  for  those  which  execute  in one of the
              selected queues or which are pending and might get scheduled  to
              those queues in principle.


       --pprrii   Displays  additional information for each job related to the job
              priorities in general.  (see OUTPUT FORMATS below).

       --qq wwcc__qquueeuuee__lliisstt
              Specifies a wildcard expression queue list to which job informa-
              tion is to be displayed. Find the definition of wwcc__qquueeuuee__lliisstt in
              _s_g_e___t_y_p_e_s(1).

       --qqss {{aa||cc||dd||oo||ss||uu||AA||CC||DD||EE||SS}}
              Allows for the filtering of queue instances according to state.

       --rr     Prints extended information about the resource  requirements  of
              the displayed jobs.

              Please  refer  to the OOUUTTPPUUTT FFOORRMMAATTSS sub-section EExxppaannddeedd FFoorrmmaatt
              below for detailed information.

              Prints only jobs in the  specified  state,  any  combination  of
              states is possible. --ss pprrss corresponds to the regular _q_s_t_a_t out-
              put without --ss at all. To show recently finished jobs, use --ss zz.
              To  display  jobs in user/operator/system/array-dependency hold,
              use the --ss hhuu//hhoo//hhss//hhdd option. The --ss hhaa option shows jobs which
              where  submitted with the _q_s_u_b --aa command.  _q_s_t_a_t --ss hhjj displays
              all jobs which are not eligible for execution unless the job has
              entries  in the job dependency list.  _q_s_t_a_t --ss hh is an abbrevia-
              tion for _q_s_t_a_t --ss hhuuhhoohhsshhddhhjjhhaa and _q_s_t_a_t --ss aa is an abbreviation
              for  _q_s_t_a_t --ss ppssrr (see --aa, --hhoolldd__jjiidd and --hhoolldd__jjiidd__aadd options to
              _q_s_u_b(1)).

       --tt     Prints extended information about the  controlled  sub-tasks  of
              the  displayed parallel jobs. Please refer to the OOUUTTPPUUTT FFOORRMMAATTSS
              sub-section RReedduucceedd FFoorrmmaatt below for detailed information.  Sub-
              tasks  of  parallel  jobs  should not be confused with array job
              tasks (see --gg option above and --tt option to _q_s_u_b(1)).

       --UU uusseerr,,......
              Displays status information with respect to queues to which  the
              specified users have access. Status information for jobs is dis-
              played either for those which execute in  one  of  the  selected
              queues  or  which  are  pending and might get scheduled to those
              queues in principle.

       --uu uusseerr,,......
              Display information only on those jobs and queues being  associ-
              ated  with  the  users  from  the given user list.  Queue status
              information is displayed if the --ff or --FF options  are  specified
              additionally and if the user runs jobs in those queues.

              The  string  $$uusseerr is a placeholder for the current username. An
              asterisk "*" can be used as username  wildcard  to  request  any
              users'  jobs  be displayed. The default value for this switch is
              --uu $$uusseerr.


       --uurrgg   Displays additional information for each job related to the  job
              urgency policy scheme (see OUTPUT FORMATS below).

       --xxmmll   This  option  can be used with all other options and changes the
              output to XML. The used schemas are referenced in the  XML  out-
              put.  The output is printed to stdout.  For more detailed infor-
              mation, the schemas for  the  qstat  command  can  be  found  in
              $SGE_ROOT/util/resources/schemas/qstat.

              If  the --xxmmll parameter is combined with --nnccbb then the XML output
              does not contain tags with information about job to  core  bind-
              ing.   You  can also find schema files with the suffix "_ncb" in
              the   directory   $SGE_ROOT/util/resources/schemas/qstat    that
              describe that changes.

       Depending  on  the  presence or absence of the --eexxppllaaiinn, --ff, --FF, or --qqss
       and --rr and --tt option three output formats need to be differentiated.

       The --eexxtt and --uurrgg options may be used to display additional information
       for each job.

       Following the header line a section for each cluster queue is provided.
       When queue instances selection are applied (-l -pe, -q, -U) the cluster
       format   contains  only  cluster  queues  of  the  corresponding  queue
       instances.

       +o  the cluster queue name.

       +o  an average of the normalized load average of  all  queue  hosts.  In
          order  to  reflect  each  hosts different significance the number of
          configured slots is used as  a  weighting  factor  when  determining
          cluster   queue   load.    Please   note  that  only  hosts  with  a
          np_load_value are considered for this value. When queue selection is
          applied  only  data about selected queues is considered in this for-
          mula. If the load value is not available at any of the hosts  '-NA-'
          is  printed  instead of the value from the complex attribute defini-
          tion.

       +o  the number of currently used slots.

       +o  the number of slots reserved in advance.

       +o  the number of currently available slots.

       +o  the total number of slots.

       +o  the number of slots which is in at least one of the states  'aoACDS'
          and in none of the states 'cdsuE'

       +o  the number of slots which are in one of these states or in any  com-
          bination of them: 'cdsuE'

       +o  the --gg cc option can be used in combination with --eexxtt. In this  case,
          additional columns are added to the output. Each column contains the
          slot count for one of the available queue states.

   RReedduucceedd FFoorrmmaatt ((wwiitthhoouutt --ff,, --FF,, aanndd --qqss))
       Following the header line a line is printed for each job consisting of

       +o  the job ID.

       +o  the priority of the job determining its position in the pending jobs
          list.   The priority value is determined dynamically based on ticket
          and urgency policy set-up (see also _s_g_e___p_r_i_o_r_i_t_y(5) ).

       +o  the name of the job.

       +o  the user name of the job owner.

       +o  the status  of  the  job  -  one  of  d(eletion),  E(rror),  h(old),
          r(unning),  R(estarted),  s(uspended),  S(uspended),  t(ransfering),
          T(hreshold) or w(aiting).

          The state d(eletion) indicates that a _q_d_e_l(1) has been used to  ini-
          tiate job deletion.  The states t(ransfering) and r(unning) indicate
          that a job is about to be executed or is already executing,  whereas
          the  states  s(uspended),  S(uspended)  and T(hreshold) show that an
          already running jobs has been suspended. The  s(uspended)  state  is
          caused   by   suspending  the  job  via  the  _q_m_o_d(1)  command,  the
          S(uspended) state indicates that the queue  containing  the  job  is
          suspended  and  therefore the job is also suspended and the T(hresh-
          old) state shows that at least one suspend threshold of  the  corre-
          sponding queue was exceeded (see _q_u_e_u_e___c_o_n_f(5)) and that the job has
          been suspended as a consequence.  The  state  R(estarted)  indicates
          that the job was restarted. This can be caused by a job migration or
          because of one of the reasons described in the  -r  section  of  the
          _q_s_u_b(1) command.

          The  states  w(aiting)  and h(old) only appear for pending jobs. The
          h(old) state indicates that a job currently is not eligible for exe-
          cution due to a hold state assigned to it via _q_h_o_l_d(1), _q_a_l_t_e_r(1) or
          the _q_s_u_b(1) --hh option or that the job is waiting for  completion  of
          the jobs to which job dependencies have been assigned to the job via
          the --hhoolldd__jjiidd or --hhoolldd__jjiidd--aadd options of _q_s_u_b(1) or _q_a_l_t_e_r(1).

          The state E(rror) appears for pending jobs that couldn't be  started
          due  to job properties. The reason for the job error is shown by the
          _q_s_t_a_t(1) --jj jjoobb__lliisstt option.

       +o  the submission or start time and date of the job.

       +o  the queue the job is assigned to  (for  running  or  suspended  jobs
          only).

       +o  the  number of job slots or the function of parallel job tasks if --gg
          tt is specified.

          Without --gg tt  option  the  total  number  of  slots  occupied  resp.
          requested  by the job is displayed. For pending parallel jobs with a
          PE slot range request, the assumed future slot  allocation  is  dis-
          played.   With  --gg tt option the function of the running jobs (MASTER
          or SLAVE - the latter for parallel jobs only) is displayed.

       +o  the array job task id. Will be empty for non-array jobs. See the  --tt
          option to _q_s_u_b(1) and the --gg above for additional information.

       If the --tt option is supplied, each status line always contains parallel
       job task information as if --gg tt were specified and each  line  contains
       the following parallel job subtask information:

       +o  the  parallel  task ID (do not confuse parallel tasks with array job
          tasks),

       +o  the status of the parallel task -  one  of  r(unning),  R(estarted),
          s(uspended),   S(uspended),   T(hreshold),   w(aiting),  h(old),  or
          x(exited).

       +o  the cpu, memory, and I/O usage,

       +o  the exit status of the parallel task,

       +o  and the failure code and message for the parallel task.

   FFuullll FFoorrmmaatt ((wwiitthh --ff aanndd --FF))
       Following the header line a section for each queue separated by a hori-
       zontal  line  is  provided. For each queue the information printed con-
       sists of

       +o  the queue name,

       +o  the queue type - one  of  B(atch),  I(nteractive),  C(heckpointing),
          P(arallel), or combinations thereof or N(one),

       +o  the number of used and available job slots,

       +o  the load average of the queue host,

       +o  the architecture of the queue host and

       +o  the  state  of  the  queue  -  one of u(nknown) if the corresponding
          _s_g_e___e_x_e_c_d(8) cannot be contacted, a(larm), A(larm),  C(alendar  sus-
          pended), s(uspended), S(ubordinate), d(isabled), D(isabled), E(rror)
          or combinations thereof.

       If the state is a(larm) at least on of the load thresholds  defined  in
       the _l_o_a_d___t_h_r_e_s_h_o_l_d_s list of the queue configuration (see _q_u_e_u_e___c_o_n_f(5))
       is currently exceeded, which prevents from scheduling further  jobs  to
       that queue.

       As  opposed  to  this, the state A(larm) indicates that at least one of
       the suspend thresholds of the queue (see  _q_u_e_u_e___c_o_n_f(5))  is  currently
       exceeded.  This will result in jobs running in that queue being succes-
       sively suspended until no threshold is violated.

       The states s(uspended) and d(isabled) can be  assigned  to  queues  and
       released  via  the  _q_m_o_d(1)  command. Suspending a queue will cause all
       jobs executing in that queue to be suspended.

       The states D(isabled) and C(alendar suspended) indicate that the  queue
       has  been disabled or suspended automatically via the calendar facility
       of Grid Engine (see _c_a_l_e_n_d_a_r___c_o_n_f(5)), while  the  S(ubordinate)  state
       indicates,  that  the  queue  has  been  suspended via subordination to
       another queue (see _q_u_e_u_e___c_o_n_f(5) for details). When suspending a  queue
       (regardless  of  the  cause)  all jobs executing in that queue are sus-
       pended too.

       The state P(reempted) indicates that the queue has  been  disabled  via
       slotwise  subordination  to  another  queue, preventing it getting jobs
       which would simply be suspended.

       If an E(rror) state is displayed for a queue, _s_g_e___e_x_e_c_d(8) on that host
       was  unable  to  locate  the _s_g_e___s_h_e_p_h_e_r_d(8) executable on that host in
       order  to  start  a  job.  Please  check  the  error  logfile  of  that
       _s_g_e___e_x_e_c_d(8) for leads on how to resolve the problem. Please enable the
       queue afterwards via the --cc option of the _q_m_o_d(1) command manually.

       If the  c(onfiguration  ambiguous)  state  is  displayed  for  a  queue
       instance this indicates that the configuration specified for this queue
       instance in _s_g_e___c_o_n_f(5) is ambiguous. This state is  cleared  when  the
       configuration  becomes  unambiguous  again. This state prevents further
       jobs from being scheduled to that queue instance. Detailed reasons  why
       a  queue  instance  entered  the c(onfiguration ambiguous) state can be
       found in the _s_g_e___q_m_a_s_t_e_r(8) messages file and are shown  by  the  qstat
       -explain  switch. For queue instances in this state the cluster queue's
       default settings are used for the ambiguous attribute.

       If an o(rphaned) state is displayed for a queue instance, it  indicates
       that  the  queue  instance is no longer demanded by the current cluster
       queue's configuration or  the  host  group  configuration.   The  queue
       instance  is  kept  because  jobs which not yet finished jobs are still
       associated with it, and it will vanish from  qstat  output  when  these
       jobs  have finished. To quicken vanishing of an orphaned queue instance
       associated job(s) can be deleted using _q_d_e_l(1).  A  queue  instance  in
       (o)rphaned  state can be revived by changing the cluster queue configu-
       ration accordingly to cover that queue instance.  This  state  prevents
       from scheduling further jobs to that queue instance.

       If the --FF option was used, resource availability information is printed
       following the queue status line. For each resource (as selected  in  an
       option  argument  to --FF or for all resources if the option argument was
       omitted) a single line is displayed with the following format:

       +o  a one letter  specifier  indicating  whether  the  current  resource
          availability value was dominated by either
          `gg' - a cluster global,
          `hh' - a host total or
          `qq' - a queue related resource consumption.

       +o  a  second one letter specifier indicating the source for the current
          resource availability value, being one of
          `ll' - a load value reported for the resource,
          `LL' - a load value for the resource after administrator defined load
          scaling has been applied,
          `cc'  -  availability  derived from the consumable resources facility
          (see _c_o_m_p_l_e_x_e_s(5)),
          `ff' - a fixed availability definition derived from a  non-consumable
          complex attribute or a fixed resource limit.

       +o  after  a colon the name of the resource on which information is dis-
          played.

       +o  after an equal sign the current resource availability value.

       The displayed availability values  and  the  sources  from  which  they
       derive  are  always  the  minimum  values of all possible combinations.
       Hence, for example, a line of the form "qf:h_vmem=4G" indicates that  a
       queue currently has a maximum availability in virtual memory of 4 Giga-
       byte, where this value is a fixed value (e.g. a resource limit  in  the
       queue  configuration) and it is queue dominated, i.e. the host in total
       may have more virtual memory available than this, but the queue doesn't
       allow for more. Contrarily a line "hl:h_vmem=4G" would also indicate an
       upper bound of 4 Gigabyte virtual memory availability,  but  the  limit
       would  be derived from a load value currently reported for the host. So
       while the queue  might  allow  for  jobs  with  higher  virtual  memory
       requirements, the host on which this particular queue resides currently
       only has 4 Gigabyte available.

       If the --eexxppllaaiinn option was used with the character 'a' or 'A', informa-
       tion about resources is displayed, that violate load or suspend thresh-
       olds.
       The same format as with the --FF option is  used  with  following  exten-
       sions:

       +o  the line starts with the keyword `alarm'

       +o  appended  to  the resource value is the type and value of the appro-
          priate threshold

       After the queue status line (in case of --ff) or the resource  availabil-
       ity  information  (in case of --FF) a single line is printed for each job
       running currently in this queue. Each job status line contains

       +o  the job ID,

       +o  the priority of the job determining its position in the pending jobs
          list.   The priority value is determined dynamically based on ticket
          and urgency policy set-up (see also _s_g_e___p_r_i_o_r_i_t_y(5) ).

       +o  the job name,

       +o  the job owner name,

       +o  the  status  of  the  job  -  one   of   t(ransfering),   r(unning),
          R(estarted),   s(uspended),  S(uspended)  or  T(hreshold)  (see  the
          RReedduucceedd FFoorrmmaatt section for detailed information),

       +o  the submission or start time and date of the job.

       +o  the number of job slots or the function of parallel job tasks if  --gg
          tt is specified.

          Without  --gg  tt  option  the number of slots occupied per queue resp.
          requested by the job is displayed. For pending parallel jobs with  a
          PE  slot  range  request, the assumed future slot allocation is dis-
          played.  With --gg tt option the function of the running  jobs  (MASTER
          or SLAVE - the latter for parallel jobs only) is displayed.

       If the --tt option is supplied, each job status line also contains

       +o  the task ID,

       +o  the status of the task - one of r(unning), R(estarted), s(uspended),
          S(uspended), T(hreshold), w(aiting), h(old), or x(exited)  (see  the
          RReedduucceedd FFoorrmmaatt section for detailed information),

       +o  the cpu, memory, and I/O usage,

       +o  the exit status of the task,

       +o  and the failure code and message for the task.

       Following the list of queue sections a _P_E_N_D_I_N_G _J_O_B_S list may be printed
       in case jobs are waiting for being assigned to a queue.  A status  line
       for each waiting job is displayed being similar to the one for the run-
       ning jobs. The differences are that the status for the jobs  is  w(ait-
       ing)  or  h(old), that the submit time and date is shown instead of the
       start time and that no function is displayed for the jobs.

       In very rare cases, e.g. if _s_g_e___q_m_a_s_t_e_r(8) starts up from an  inconsis-
       tent  state in the job or queue spool files or if the cclleeaann qquueeuuee (--ccqq)
       option of _q_c_o_n_f(1) is used, _q_s_t_a_t cannot assign jobs to either the run-
       ning  or pending jobs section of the output. In this case as job status
       inconsistency (e.g. a job has a running status but is not assigned to a
       queue)  has  been detected. Such jobs are printed in an _E_R_R_O_R _J_O_B_S sec-
       tion at the very end of the output. The ERROR JOBS section should  dis-
       appear upon restart of _s_g_e___q_m_a_s_t_e_r(8).  Please contact your Grid Engine
       support representative if you feel uncertain about the cause or effects
       of such jobs.

       If  the  --rr  option  was  specified  together with _q_s_t_a_t, the following

       of the following job characteristics):

       +o  The job and master queue name.

       +o  The hard and soft resource requirements of the job as specified with
          the _q_s_u_b(1) --ll option. The per resource addend when determining  the
          jobs  urgency  contribution  value  is  printed (see also _s_g_e___p_r_i_o_r_-

                      length, one can set SGE_LONG_QNAMES to -1 and qstat will
                      figure out the best length.
