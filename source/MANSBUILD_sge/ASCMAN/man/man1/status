       This manual page documents ssttaattuuss, a script to reformat the
        output of the Grid Engine command _q_s_t_a_t(1).

       The  reformatted list is by default limited to the actual user account.
       This can be changed to request a job list of any user by supplying  the
       username  _U_S_E_R  as  the  last argument, or requesting an output for all
       users by the --aa switch (see below).

   OOppttiioonnss
       --aa     Display the jobs of all users. May not be used when there  is  a
              dedicated  user  specified.  This also implies the output of the
              owner of the jobs.

       --cc     Calculate a statistic of the listed jobs.

       --gg     Group output by owner. Only applicable if the owner  is  listed,
              either  by  the --oo switch or implied by --aa. This is a short form
              of '--ss oowwnneerr,rruunnnniinngg'.  Can't  be  used  together  with  the  --ss
              option.

       --hh     Print help.

       --jj     Include jobs which are suspended.

       --ll     Suppress  the  output  of the list of jobs. Maybe useful in case
              you are only interested in the statistic with the --cc switch.

       --mm     Display the machine instead of the name of the queue the job  is
              running in under the column 'running in'.

       --nn     Suppress the listing of the individual owner, mostly useful when
              all jobs are listed. Takes precedence  over  any  other  implied
              options.   If used together with --oo, only the later one is rele-
              vant.

       --oo     List the owner of the individual job. Takes precedence over  any
              other  implied  option. If used together with --nn, only the later
              one is relevant.

       --rr     Display times relative to submit- or start-times,  as  appropri-
              ate.

       --ss _S_O_R_T___F_I_E_L_D___L_I_S_T
              Sort   the   output   according   to   the  given  columns.  The
              _S_O_R_T___F_I_E_L_D___L_I_S_T            has            the             format
              _S_O_R_T___F_I_E_L_D___L_I_S_T=_S_O_R_T___F_I_E_L_D[,_S_O_R_T___F_I_E_L_D]* where _S_O_R_T___F_I_E_L_D can be
              one of jjoobb, nnaammee, nnoonnee, oowwnneerr, rruunnnniinngg, sslloottss, ttiimmee.

              The option nnoonnee will supersede any other column  names  and  set
              the complete sort order to none.

              The  column  oowwnneerr  can  only be used if the owner of the job is
              displayed at all. Otherwise it will be ignored.

              The sort by rruunnnniinngg will only be used for the running jobs,  not
              for the waiting ones.

              This will overwrite the default sort order, which is:

                     running jobs:  rruunnnniinngg
                     waiting jobs:  nnoonnee

              If the option --gg is specified, the default sort order is changed
              to:

                     running jobs:  oowwnneerr,rruunnnniinngg
                     waiting jobs:  oowwnneerr


       --tt     Append task ID to the jobname for array tasks. This  option  has
              no meaning for non-array jobs.
