       sge_intro  -  Grid  Engine,  a  facility  for  executing jobs on remote
       machines

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       Grid Engine is a facility for executing  Unix-like  batch  jobs  (shell
       scripts or binaries) on a pool of cooperating CPUs. Jobs are queued and
       executed remotely according to defined policies.  The CPUs  may  be  in
       desktop  systems, with jobs run on them at times when they would other-
       wise be idle or only lightly loaded. The work load may  be  distributed
       according  to  the (generalized) load situation of each machine and the
       resource requirements of the jobs.

       User level checkpointing  programs  are  supported  and  a  transparent
       checkpointing  mechanism  is provided (see _s_g_e___c_k_p_t(1)).  Checkpointing
       jobs migrate from system to system without user  intervention  on  load
       demand. In addition to simple batch jobs, interactive jobs and parallel
       jobs can also be submitted to Grid Engine.

       The Grid Engine user interface consists of several programs  which  are
       described separately.

       _q_a_c_c_t(1)
              _q_a_c_c_t extracts arbitrary accounting information from the cluster
              logfile.

       _q_a_l_t_e_r(1)
              _q_a_l_t_e_r changes the characteristics of already submitted jobs.

       _q_c_o_n_f(1)
              _q_c_o_n_f provides the user interface  for  configuring,  modifying,
              deleting and querying queues and the cluster configuration.

       _q_d_e_l(1)
              _q_d_e_l  provides  the  means for a user/operator/manager to cancel
              jobs.

       _q_h_o_l_d(1)
              _q_h_o_l_d holds back submitted jobs from execution.

       _q_h_o_s_t(1)
              _q_h_o_s_t displays status information about  Grid  Engine  execution
              hosts.

       _q_l_o_g_i_n(1)
              _q_l_o_g_i_n  initiates  a  telnet or similar login session with auto-
              matic selection of a suitable host.

       _q_m_a_k_e(1)
              _q_m_a_k_e is a replacement for the standard Unix _m_a_k_e  facility.  It
              extends  make  with  an  ability  to distribute independent make
              steps across a cluster of suitable machines.

       _q_m_o_d(1)
              _q_m_o_d allows the owner(s)  of  a  queue  to  suspend  and  enable
              queues,  e.g.  all  queues associated with his machine (all cur-
              rently active processes in this queue are also signaled)  or  to
              suspend and enable jobs executing in the queues.

       _q_m_o_n(1)
              _q_m_o_n provides a Motif command interface to all Grid Engine func-
              tions. The status of all, or a private selection of, the config-
              ured  queues  is  displayed on-line by changing colors at corre-
              sponding queue icons.

       _q_q_u_o_t_a(1)
              _q_q_u_o_t_a provides a status listing of all currently used  resource
              quotas (see _s_g_e___r_e_s_o_u_r_c_e___q_u_o_t_a(5)).

       _q_r_e_s_u_b(1)
              _q_r_e_s_u_b  creates new jobs by copying currently running or pending
              jobs.

       _q_r_l_s(1)
              _q_r_l_s releases holds from jobs previously assigned to  them  e.g.
              via _q_h_o_l_d(1) (see above).

       _q_r_d_e_l(1)
              _q_r_d_e_l provides the means to cancel advance reservations.

       _q_r_s_h(1)
              _q_r_s_h  can  be used for various purposes such as providing remote
              execution of interactive applications via Grid Engine comparable
              to  the  standard Unix facility rsh, to allow for the submission
              of batch jobs which, upon execution, support terminal I/O (stan-
              dard/error  output  and standard input) and terminal control, to
              provide a batch job submission client which remains active until
              the  job has finished or to allow for the Grid Engine-controlled
              remote execution of the tasks of parallel jobs.

       _q_r_s_t_a_t(1)
              _q_r_s_t_a_t provides a status listing of all advance reservations  in
              the cluster.

       _q_r_s_u_b(1)
              _q_r_s_u_b  is  the user interface for submitting an advance reserva-
              tion to Grid Engine.

       _q_s_e_l_e_c_t(1)
              _q_s_e_l_e_c_t prints a list of queue names corresponding to  specified
              selection  criteria.  The  output of _q_s_e_l_e_c_t is usually fed into
              other Grid Engine commands to apply actions on a selected set of
              queues.

       _q_s_h(1) _q_s_h  opens an interactive shell (in an _x_t_e_r_m(1)) on a low loaded
              host. Any kind of interactive job can be run in this shell.

       _q_s_t_a_t(1)
              _q_s_t_a_t provides a status listing of all jobs and  queues  associ-
              ated with the cluster.

       _q_t_c_s_h(1)
              _q_t_c_s_h is a fully compatible replacement for the widely known and
              used Unix C-Shell (_c_s_h) derivative _t_c_s_h. It provides a  command-
              shell with the extension of transparently distributing execution
              of designated applications to suitable and lightly loaded  hosts
              via Grid Engine.

       _q_s_u_b(1)
              _q_s_u_b is the user interface for submitting a job to Grid Engine.
