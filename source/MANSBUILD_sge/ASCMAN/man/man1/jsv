       JSV - Grid Engine Job Submission Verifier

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       JSV  is  an abbreviation for Job Submission Verifier. A JSV is a script
       or binary that can be used to verify, modify or reject a job during job
       submission.

       JSVs  will be triggered by submit clients like _q_s_u_b, _q_r_s_h, _q_s_h and _q_m_o_n
       on submit hosts (Client JSV), or they verify incoming jobs on the  mas-
       ter host (Server JSV), or both.

CCOONNFFIIGGUURRAATTIIOONN
       JSVs  can  be  configured in various locations. Either a jjssvv__uurrll can be
       provided with the --jjssvv submit parameter during job submission, a corre-
       sponding  switch  can  be  added  to one of the ssggee__rreeqquueesstt files, or a
       jjssvv__uurrll can be configured in the global cluster  configuration  of  the
       Grid Engine installation.

       All defined JSV instances will be executed in following order:

          1) qsub -jsv ...
          2) $cwd/.sge_request
          3) $HOME/.sge_request
          4) $SGE_ROOT/$SGE_CELL/common/sge_request
          5) Global configuration

       The  Client JSVs (1-3) can be defined by Grid Engine end users, whereas
       the client JSV defined in the  global  sge_request  file  (4)  and  the
       server JSV (5) can only be defined by the Grid Engine administrators.

       Due  to  the  fact  that (4) and (5) are defined and configured by Grid
       Engine administrators and executed as the last  JSV  instances  in  the
       sequence  of JSV scripts, an administrator has a way to enforce certain
       policies for a cluster.

       As soon as one JSV instance rejects a job the whole process of  verifi-
       cation  is stopped and the end user will get a corresponding error mes-
       sage that the submission of the job has failed.

       If a JSV accepts a job, or accepts a job after it applied several modi-
       fications,  then the following JSV instance will get the job parameters
       including all modifications as  input  for  the  verification  process.
       This is done as long as either the job is accepted or rejected.

       Find  more  information  on  how to use Client JSVs in _q_s_u_b(1), and for
       Server JSVs in _s_g_e___c_o_n_f(5).

LLIIFFEETTIIMMEE
       A Client or Server JSV is started as own  UNIX  process.  This  process
       communicates  either  with  a  Grid Engine client process or the master
       daemon by exchanging commands,  job  parameters,  and  other  data  via
       ssttddiinn/ssttddoouutt channels.

       Client JSV instances are started by client applications before a job is
       sent to qmaster. This instance does the job verification for the job to
       be submitted. After that verification the JSV process is stopped.

       Server  JSV  instances  are  started for each worker thread part of the
       qmaster process.  (For version 6.2 of Grid Engine this means  that  two
       processes  are  started.)   Each  of  those processes has to verify job
       parameters for multiple jobs as long as  the  master  is  running,  the
       underlying JSV configuration is not changed, and no error occurs.

TTIIMMEEOOUUTT
       The  timeout  is a modifiable value that will measure the response time
       of either the client or server JSV. In the event that the response time
       of  the JSV is longer than timeout value specified, this will result in
       the JSV being re-started. The server JSV  timeout  value  is  specified
       through  the  qmaster  parameter  jjssvv__ttiimmeeoouutt.   The client JSV timeout
       value is set through  the  environment  variable  SSGGEE__JJSSVV__TTIIMMEEOOUUTT.  The
       default  value is 10 seconds, and this value must be greater than 0. If
       the timeout has been reached, the JSV will only try to  re-start  once,
       and if the timeout is reached again, an error will occur.

TTHHRREESSHHOOLLDD
       The  threshold  value  is defined as a qmaster parameter jjssvv__tthhrreesshhoolldd.
       This value measures the time for a server  job  verification.  If  this
       time  exceeds the defined threshold then additional logging will appear
       in the master message file at the INFO level. This value  is  specified
       in  milliseconds  and  has  a default value of 5000. If a value of 0 is
       defined then this means all jobs will be logged in the message file.

PPRROOTTOOCCOOLL
       After a JSV script or binary is started it will  get  commands  through
       its  ssttddiinn  stream,  and it has to respond with certain commands on the
       ssttddoouutt stream. Data sent via the ssttddeerrrr stream of  a  JSV  instance  is
       ignored. Each command which is sent to/by a JSV script has to be termi-
       nated by a new line character ('\\nn'), whereas new line  characters  are
       not allowed in the whole command string itself.

       In general, commands which are exchanged between a JSV and client/qmas-
       ter have following format. Commands and arguments are  case  sensitive.
       Find the EBNF command description below.

             ccoommmmaanndd := ccoommmmaanndd__nnaammee ' ' { aarrgguummeenntt ' ' } ;

       A ccoommmmaanndd starts with a ccoommmmaanndd__nnaammee followed by a space character  and
       a space separated list of aarrgguummeennttss.

PPRROOTTOOCCOOLL ((JJSSVV ssiiddee))
       The following ccoommmmaannddss have to be implemented by a JSV script  so  that
       it  conforms to version 1.0 of the JSV protocol, which was first imple-
       mented in Grid Engine 6.2u2:

       bbeeggiinn__ccoommmmaanndd := 'BBEEGGIINN' ;
              After a JSV instance  has  received  all  the  eennvv__ccoommmmaannddss  and
              ppaarraamm__ccoommmmaannddss   of   a   job  which  should  be  verified,  the
              client/qmaster will trigger the verification process by  sending
              one  bbeeggiinn__ccoommmmaanndd.  After  that it will wait for ppaarraamm__ccoommmmaannddss
              and eennvv__ccoommmmaannddss which are sent back from the  JSV  instance  to
              modify  the  job  specification.  As  part  of  the verification
              process a JSV script or binary has to use the rreessuulltt__ccoommmmaanndd  to
              indicate that the verification process is finished for a job.

       eennvv__ccoommmmaanndd := EENNVV ' ' mmooddiiffiieerr ' ' nnaammee ' ' vvaalluuee ;

       mmooddiiffiieerr := 'AADDDD' | 'MMOODD' | 'DDEELL' ;
              The  eennvv__ccoommmmaanndd  is  an  optional  command which has only to be
              implemented by a JSV instance if the sseenndd__ddaattaa__ccoommmmaanndd  is  sent
              by  this  JSV  before  a  ssttaarrtteedd__ccoommmmaanndd was sent. Only in that
              case, the client or master will use one or multiple eennvv__ccoommmmaannddss
              to  pass  the  environment variables (nnaammee and vvaalluuee) to the JSV
              instance to be exported to the job environment when the  job  is
              started. Client and qmaster will only send eennvv__ccoommmmaannddss with the
              modifier 'AADDDD'.

              JSV instances modify the set of environment variables by sending
              back eennvv__ccoommmmaannddss, and by using the mmooddiiffiieerrss AADDDD, MMOODD and DDEELL.

       ppaarraamm__ccoommmmaanndd := 'PPAARRAAMM' ' ' ppaarraamm__ppaarraammeetteerr ' ' vvaalluuee ;

       ppaarraamm__ppaarraammeetteerr := ssuubbmmiitt__ppaarraammeetteerr | ppsseeuuddoo__ppaarraammeetteerr ;
              The  ppaarraamm__ccoommmmaanndd  has two additional arguments which are sepa-
              rated by space characters. The first argument is either  a  ssuubb--
              mmiitt__ppaarraammeetteerr as specified in _q_s_u_b(1), or it is a ppsseeuuddoo__ppaarraammee--
              tteerrss as documented below.  The second parameter is the vvaalluuee  of
              the corresponding ppaarraamm__ppaarraammeetteerr.

              Multiple ppaarraamm__ccoommmmaannddss will be sent to a JSV instance after the
              JSV has sent a ssttaarrtteedd__ccoommmmaanndd. The sum  of  all  ppaarraamm__ccoommmmaannddss
              sent  represents  a job specification of the job which should be
              verified.

              ssuubbmmiitt__ppaarraammeetteerrss are, for example, bb (similar to  the  qqssuubb  --bb
              switch),  or  mmaasstteerrqq  (similar to qqssuubb --mmaasstteerrqq switch). Find a
              complete list of ssuubbmmiitt__ppaarraammeetteerrss  in  the  _q_s_u_b(1)  man  page.
              Please  note that the ppaarraamm__ppaarraammeetteerr name and the corresponding
              vvaalluuee format is not equivalent to the qsub switch name  and  its
              argument format in all cases.  E.g. the qqssuubb --ppee parameters will
              by available as a set  of  parameters  with  the  name  ppee__nnaammee,
              ppee__mmiinn,  ppee__mmaaxx  and  the  switch  combination  --ssoofftt --ll will be
              passed to JSV scripts as ll__ssoofftt parameter. For details  concern-
              ing this differences consult also the _q_s_u_b(1) man page.

       ssttaarrtt__ccoommmmaanndd := 'SSTTAARRTT' ;
              The  ssttaarrtt__ccoommmmaanndd  has  no  additional  arguments. This command
              indicates that a new job verification should be started.  It  is
              the  first command which will be sent to JSV script after it has
              been started and it will initiate each new job  verification.  A
              JSV  instance  might  trash cached values which are still stored
              due to a previous job verification. The application which  sends
              the ssttaarrtt__ccoommmmaanndd will wait for a ssttaarrtteedd__ccoommmmaanndd before it con-
              tinues.

       qquuiitt__ccoommmmaanndd := 'QQUUIITT' ;
              The qquuiitt__ccoommmmaanndd has no additional arguments. If this command is
              sent  to  a JSV instance then it should terminate itself immedi-
              ately.

PPRROOTTOOCCOOLL ((cclliieenntt//qqmmaasstteerr ssiiddee))
       A JSV script or binary can send a set of commands to  a  client/qmaster
       process  to  indicate its state in the communication process, to change
       the job specification of a job which should be verified, and to  report
       messages  or  errors.  Below you can find the commands which are under-
       stood by the client/qmaster which implements version 1.0 of the  commu-
       nication protocol introduced in Grid Engine 6.2u2:

       eerrrroorr__ccoommmmaanndd := 'EERRRROORR' mmeessssaaggee ;
              Any  time a JSV script encounters an error it might report it to
              the client/qmaster. If the error happens during a job  verifica-
              tion  the  job which is currently verified will be rejected. The
              JSV binary or script will also be restarted before it gets a new
              verification task.

       lloogg__ccoommmmaanndd := 'LLOOGG' lloogg__lleevveell ;

       lloogg__lleevveell := 'IINNFFOO' | 'WWAARRNNIINNGG' | 'EERRRROORR'
              lloogg__ccoommmmaannddss  can be used whenever the client or qmaster expects
              input from a JSV instance. This command can be  used  in  client
              JSVs  to  send  information  to  the user submitting the job. In
              client JSVs all messages, independent of the lloogg__lleevveell, will  be
              printed  to  the ssttddoouutt stream of the submit client. If a server
              JSV receives a lloogg__ccoommmmaanndd it will add the received  message  to
              the  message  file,  respecting  the specified lloogg__lleevveell. Please
              note that mmeessssaaggee might contain spaces, but no new line  charac-
              ters.

       ppaarraamm__ccoommmmaanndd (find definition above)
              By sending ppaarraamm__ccoommmmaannddss, a JSV script can change the job spec-
              ification of the job which should be verified. If a JSV instance
              later  on  sends  a  rreessuulltt__ccoommmmaanndd  which  indicates that a JSV
              instance should be accepted with corrections,  then  the  values
              provided  with  these  ppaarraamm__ccoommmmaannddss will be used to modify the
              job before it is accepted by the Grid Engine system.

       rreessuulltt__ccoommmmaanndd := 'RREESSUULLTT' rreessuulltt__ttyyppee [ mmeessssaaggee ] ;

              After the verification of a job is done, a JSV script or  binary
              has  to send a rreessuulltt__ccoommmmaanndd which indicates what should happen
              with the job.  If the rreessuulltt__ttyyppee is AACCCCEEPPTTEEDD the  job  will  be
              accepted  as  it  was  initially  submitted by the end user. All
              ppaarraamm__ccoommmmaannddss and  eennvv__ccoommmmaannddss  which  might  have  been  sent
              before  the  rreessuulltt__ccoommmmaanndd  are  ignored  in  this  case.   The
              rreessuulltt__ttyyppee CCOORRRREECCTT indicates that the job  should  be  accepted
              after all modifications sent via ppaarraamm__ccoommmmaannddss and eennvv__ccoommmmaannddss
              are applied to the job.  RREEJJEECCTT and RREEJJEECCTT__WWAAIITT cause the client
              or qmaster instance to reject the job.

       ddaattaa__nnaammee := 'EENNVV';
              If  a  client/qmaster  receives  a  sseenndd__eennvv__ccoommmmaanndd  from a JSV
              instance before a ssttaarrtteedd__ccoommmmaanndd is sent, then it will not only
              pass  job  parameters with ppaarraamm__ccoommmmaannddss, but also eennvv__ccoommmmaannddss
              which provide the JSV with the information about which  environ-
              ment  variables  will  be exported to the job environment if the
              job is accepted and started later on.

              The job environment is not passed to JSV  instances  by  default
              because  the  job environment of the end user might contain data
              which might be interpreted wrongly in the JSV context, and might
              therefore cause errors or security issues.

       ssttaarrtteedd__ccoommmmaanndd := 'SSTTAARRTTEEDD' ;
              By  sending the ssttaarrtteedd__ccoommmmaanndd a JSV instance indicates that it

       CCLLIIEENNTT The corresponding value  for  the  CCLLIIEENNTT  parameter  is  either
              'qqmmaasstteerr'  or  the  name  of  a  submit client like 'qqssuubb', This
              parameter value can't be changed  by  JSV  instances.   It  will
              always be sent as part of a job verification.

       CCMMDDAARRGGSS
              Number  of  arguments  which will be passed to the job script or
              command  when the job execution is started.  It will  always  be
              sent  as  part of a job verification.  If no arguments should be
              passed to the job script or command it will have  the  value  0.
              This  parameter can be changed by JSV instances. If the value of
              CCMMDDAARRGGSS is bigger than the number of available  CCMMDDAARRGG_n  parame-
              ters,  then  the missing parameters will be automatically passed
              as empty parameters to the job script.

       CCMMDDAARRGG_n
              Individual command arguments, where _n is an  integer  between  0
              and CCMMDDAARRGGSS-1.

       CCMMDDNNAAMMEE
              Either  the path to the script, the command name for binary sub-
              mission, SSTTDDIINN for standard input, or NNOONNEE in  the  case  of  an
              interactive  job.  It will always be sent as part of a job veri-
              fication.

       CCOONNTTEEXXTT
              Either 'cclliieenntt', if the JSV which  receives  this  ppaarraamm__ccoommmmaanndd
              was started by a command-line client like _q_s_u_b, or _q_s_h, or 'mmaass--
              tteerr' if it was started by  the  _s_g_e___q_m_a_s_t_e_r  process.   It  will
              always  be  sent  as part of a job verification.  This parameter
              value can't be changed by JSV instances.

       GGRROOUUPP  Defines the primary group of the user who tries  to  submit  the
              job  which  should be verified. This parameter cannot be changed
              but is always sent as part of the verification process. The user
              name is passed as a parameter with the name UUSSEERR.

       JJOOBB__IIDD Not  available in the client context (see CCOONNTTEEXXTT). Otherwise it
              contains the job number of the job which will  be  submitted  to
              Grid  Engine when the verification process is successful. JJOOBB__IIDD
              is  an  optional  parameter  which  can't  be  changed  by   JSV
              instances.

       UUSSEERR   User  name  of the user who tries to submit the job which should
              be verified. Cannot be changed but is always sent as part of the
              verification  process.  The  group name is passed as a parameter
              with the name GGRROOUUPP

       VVEERRSSIIOONN
              VVEERRSSIIOONN will always be  sent  as  part  of  a  job  verification
              process and it will always be the first parameter which is sent.
              It will contain a version number of the format  <major>.<minor>.
              In  version  6.2u2 and higher the value will be '11..00', or higher
              if the protocol is changed in the future.   The  value  of  this
              parameter can't be changed.

       Here  is  an  example  for  the  communication  of  a client with a JSV
       instance when the following job is submitted:

       > qsub -pe p 3 -hard -l a=1,b=5 -soft -l q=all.q $SGE_ROOT/examples/jobs/sleeper.sh

       Data in the first column are sent from the client/qmaster  to  the  JSV
       instance.  Data  contained  in  the second column are sent from the JSV
       script to the client/qmaster. Newline characters which  terminate  each
       line in the communication protocol are omitted.
