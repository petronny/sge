       _Q_p_i_n_g is used to validate the runtime status of a Grid  Engine  service
       daemon.  The current Grid Engine implementation allows one to query the
       SGE_QMASTER daemon and any running SGE_EXECD daemon. The qping  command
       is  used  to send a SIM (Status Information Message) to the destination
       daemon. The communication layer of the specified  daemon  will  respond
       with a SIRM (Status Information Response Message) which contains status
       information about the consulted daemon.

       The qping -dump and -dump_tag options allow an administrator to observe
       the  communication  protocol data flow of a Grid Engine service daemon.
       The qping -dump instruction must be started under the root account  and
       on the host where the observed daemon is running.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
   --ff
       Show full status information on each ping interval.

       _F_i_r_s_t _o_u_t_p_u_t _L_i_n_e_: The first output line shows the date and time of the
       request.

       _S_I_R_M _v_e_r_s_i_o_n_: Internal version number of the SIRM  (Status  Information
       Response Message)

       _S_I_R_M _m_e_s_s_a_g_e _i_d_: Current message id for this connection

       _s_t_a_r_t _t_i_m_e_: Start time of daemon. The format is as follows:

       MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM:SS (seconds since 01.01.1970)

       _r_u_n _t_i_m_e _[_s_]_: Run time in seconds since start time

       _m_e_s_s_a_g_e_s  _i_n _r_e_a_d _b_u_f_f_e_r_: Number of buffered messages in the communica-
       tion read buffer. The messages are buffered for the  application  (dae-
       mon). When this number grows too large the daemon is not able to handle
       all messages sent to it.

       _m_e_s_s_a_g_e_s _i_n _w_r_i_t_e _b_u_f_f_e_r_: Number of buffered messages in the communica-
       tion  write buffer. The messages are sent from the application (daemon)
       to the connected clients, but the communication layer  wasn't  able  to
       send  the  messages yet. If this number grows too large, the communica-
       tion layer isn't able to send them as fast as the application  (daemon)
       wants the messages to be sent.

       _n_r_.  _o_f  _c_o_n_n_e_c_t_e_d _c_l_i_e_n_t_s_: This is the number of clients actually con-
       nected to this daemon, including the current qping connection.

       _s_t_a_t_u_s_: The status value of the  daemon.  This  value  depends  on  the
       application  which  replies  to  the qping request.  If the application
       does not provide any information, the status is 99999.   Here  are  the
       possible status information values for the Grid Engine daemons:

          qmaster:

             _0 There is no unusual timing situation.

             _1  One or more threads has reached warning timeout. This may hap-
             pen when at least one thread does not increment  its  time  stamp
             for  an  usually  long time. A possible reason for this is a high
             workload for this thread.

             _2 One or more threads has reached error timeout. This may  happen
             when  at  least one thread has not incremented its time stamp for
             longer than 10 minutes.

             _3 The time measurement is not initialized.

          execd:

             _0 There is no unusual timing situation.

             _1 Dispatcher has reached warning timeout. This  may  happen  when
             the dispatcher does not increment its time stamp for an unusually
             long time. A possible reason for this is a high workload.

             _2 Dispatcher has reached error timeout. This may happen when  the
             dispatcher  has not incremented its time stamp for longer than 10
             minutes.

             _3 The time measurement is not initialized.


       _i_n_f_o_: Status message of the daemon. This value depends on the  applica-
       tion  which  replies to the qping request.  If the application does not
       provide any information the info message is "not available".  Here  are
       the possible status information values for the Grid Engine daemons:


          qmaster:

             The  info message contains information about the qmaster threads,
             followed by a thread state and time information. Each time one of
             the  known threads passes through its main loop the time informa-
             tion is updated. Since the qmaster has two message threads, every
             message  thread  updates the time. This means the timeout for the
             message thread (MT) can only occur  when  no  message  thread  is
             active anymore:

                THREAD_NAME: THREAD_STATE (THREAD_TIME)

                THREAD_NAME:
                   MAIN: Main thread
                   signaler: Signal thread
                   event_master: Event master thread
                   timer: Timer thread
                   worker: Worker thread
                   listener: Listener thread
                   scheduler: Scheduler thread
                   jvm: Java thread

                   The thread names above will be followed by a 3 digit number.

                THREAD_STATE:
                   R: Running
                   W: Warning
                   E: Error

                THREAD_TIME:
                   Time since last timestamp updating.

             After  the dispatcher information comes an additional information
             string which describes the complete application status.

          execd:

             The info message contains information  for  the  execd  job  dis-
             patcher:
                dispatcher: STATE (TIME)

             STATE:
                R: Running
                W: Warning
                E: Error

             TIME:
                Time since last timestamp updating.

          After  the thread information comes an additional information string
          which describes the application status.

    _M_o_n_i_t_o_r_: If available, displays statistics on a thread. The data for  each
    thread is displayed in one line. The format of this line can be changed at
    any time. Only the master implements monitoring.


   --hheellpp
       Prints a list of all options.


   --ii iinntteerrvvaall
       Set qping interval.

       The default interval is one second.  Qping  will  send  a  SIM  (Status
       Information Message) after each interval.


   --iinnffoo
       Show  full  status  information (see --ff for more information) and exit.
       The exit value 0 indicates no error. On errors qping returns with 1.


   --nnooaalliiaass
       Ignore host_aliases file, which is  located  at  _<_s_g_e___r_o_o_t_>_/_<_c_e_l_l_>_/_c_o_m_-
       _m_o_n_/_h_o_s_t___a_l_i_a_s_e_s_.   If  this  option is used it is not necessary to set
       any Grid Engine environment variable.


   --ssssll
       This option can be used to specify an SSL (Secure Socket Layer) config-
       uration.  qping  will use the configuration to connect to services run-
       ning SSL. If the Grid Engine settings file is not sourced, you have  to
       use the -noalias option to bypass the need for the SGE_ROOT environment
       variable.  The following environment variables are used to specify your
       certificates:
         SSL_CA_CERT_FILE - CA certificate file
         SSL_CERT_FILE    - certificates file
         SSL_KEY_FILE     - key file
         SSL_RAND_FILE    - rand file


   --ttccpp
       This option is used to select TCP/IP as the protocol used to connect to
       other services.


   --nnoonneewwlliinnee
       Dump output will not have a linebreak within a message, and binary mes-
       sages are not unpacked.


   --dduummpp
       This option allows an administrator to observe the communication proto-
       col data flow of a Grid Engine service daemon. The qping -dump instruc-
       tion  must be started as root and on the host where the observed daemon
       is running.

       The  output  is   written   to   stdout.   The   environment   variable
       "SGE_QPING_OUTPUT_FORMAT"  can  be  set  to hide columns, set a default
       column width or to set a hostname output format. The value of the envi-
       ronment  variable can be set to any combination of the following speci-
       fiers separated by a space character:
              "h:X"   -> hide column X
              "s:X"   -> show column X
              "w:X:Y" -> set width of column X to Y
              "hn:X"  -> set hostname output parameter X.
                         X values are "long" or "short"

       Run qping -help to see which columns are available.



   --dduummpp__ttaagg ttaagg [[ppaarraamm]]
       This option has the same meaning as -dump, but can provide more  infor-
       mation  by  specifying  the  debug level and message types qping should
       print:
          --dduummpp__ttaagg AALLLL _d_e_b_u_g _l_e_v_e_l
             This option shows all possible debug messages (APP+MSG)  for  the
             debug  levels,  ERROR, WARNING, INFO, DEBUG and DPRINTF. The con-
             tacted service must support this kind of debugging.  This  option
             is not currently implemented.
          --dduummpp__ttaagg AAPPPP _d_e_b_u_g _l_e_v_e_l
             This  option  shows only application debug messages for the debug
             levels, ERROR, WARNING, INFO, DEBUG and  DPRINTF.  The  contacted
             service  must support this kind of debugging.  This option is not
             currently implemented.
          -dump_tag MSG
             This option has the same behavior as the -dump option.


   hhoosstt
       Host where daemon is running.


   ppoorrtt
       Port which daemon has bound (used sge_qmaster/sge_execd port number).


   nnaammee
       Name of communication endpoint ("qmaster" or "execd"). A  communication
       endpoint  is  a  triplet  of  hostname/endpoint  name/endpoint id (e.g.
       hostA/qmaster/1 or subhost/qstat/4).


   iidd
       Id of communication endpoint ("1" for daemons)
