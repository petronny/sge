       _Q_m_a_k_e  is  a  parallel,  distributed _m_a_k_e(1) utility. Scheduling of the
       parallel _m_a_k_e tasks is done by Grid Engine. It is based on  _g_m_a_k_e  (GNU
       make),  version 3.78.1. Both Grid Engine and _g_m_a_k_e command line options
       can be specified. They are separated by "--".

       All Grid Engine options valid with _q_s_u_b(1) or _q_r_s_h(1) can be  specified
       with _q_m_a_k_e.  See _s_u_b_m_i_t(1) for a description of all Grid Engine command
       line options.  The _m_a_k_e(1) manual page describes the _g_m_a_k_e command line
       syntax.

       The  syntax of _q_m_a_k_e makefiles corresponds to _g_m_a_k_e and is described in
       the "GNU Make Manual".

       A typical qmake call will use the Grid Engine command line options --ccwwdd
       to  have  a  scheduled make started in the current working directory on
       the execution host, --vv PPAATTHH if the Grid Engine environment is  not  set
       up  in  the  user's  .cshrc or .profile shell resource file and request
       slots in a parallel environment (see _s_g_e___p_e(5)).

       If no resource request (Grid Engine command line option -l)  is  speci-
       fied,  qmake  will use the environment variable SGE_ARCH to request the
       same architecture as the submit host for task execution.   If  SGE_ARCH
       is  set,  the  architecture  specified in SGE_ARCH will be requested by
       inserting the option --ll aarrcchh==$$SSGGEE__AARRCCHH into the command  line  options.
       If SGE_ARCH is not set, the make tasks can be executed on any available
       architecture.  As this is critical for typical make (compile)  jobs,  a
       warning will be output.

       _q_m_a_k_e  has two different modes for allocating Grid Engine resources for
       the parallel execution of tasks:

       1.     Allocation of resources using a parallel environment. If the -pe
              option  is  used  on  the  qmake command line, a parallel job is
              scheduled by Grid Engine.  The make rules are executed as  tasks
              within this parallel job.

       2.     Dynamic  allocation  of resources. If no parallel environment is
              requested when submitting a qmake job, each make rule will  gen-
              erate an individual Grid Engine qrsh job.  All resource requests
              given to qmake will be inherited by the jobs processing the make
              rules.

       In dynamic allocation mode, additional resource requests for individual
       rules can be specified by preceding the rule by the  definition  of  an
       environment   variable   SGE_RREQ.   The   rule  then  takes  the  form
       SGE_RREQ="<request>" <rule>, e.g.  SGE_RREQ="-l lic=1" cc  -c  ...   If
       such  makefile  rules  are executed in a make utility other than qmake,
       the environment variable SGE_RREQ will be set in the environment estab-
       lished for the rule's execution - presumably without any effect.

EEXXAAMMPPLLEESS
              qmake -cwd -v PATH -pe compiling 1-10 --

       will  request  between  1 and 10 slots in parallel environment "compil-
       ing".  If the SGE_ARCH environment  variable  is  set  to  the  machine
       architecture,  a  resource request will be inserted into the qmake com-
       mand line to start the qmake job on the same architecture as the submit
       host. The _m_a_k_e tasks will inherit the complete environment of the call-
       ing shell, and as as many parallel tasks will  execute  as  slots  have
       been granted by Grid Engine.

              qmake -l arch=sol-sparc -cwd -v PATH -- -j 4

       will  submit  each  make rule as an individual qrsh job. A maximum of 4
       tasks will be processed in parallel.  The qmake job will be started  on
       a machine of architecture sol-sparc, this resource request will also be
       inherited by the make tasks, i.e. all jobs created for the execution of
       make tasks will request the architecture sol-sparc.

       If  the  following  Makefile  is submitted with the above command line,
       additional resource requests will be made for individual rules: For the
       compile  and  link  rules, compiler licenses (comp) and linker licenses
       (link) will be requested, in addition to the resource request made  for
       the whole job (-l arch=sol-sparc) on the command line.

              all: test

              clean:
                   rm -f test main.o functions.o

              test: main.o functions.o
                   SGE_RREQ="-l link=1" ld -o test main.o functions.o

              main.o: main.c
                   SGE_RREQ="-l comp=1" cc -c -DALIASPATH=

              functions.o: functions.c
                   SGE_RREQ="-l comp=1" cc -c -DALIASPATH=


       The command line
              qmake -cwd -v PATH -l arch=sol-sparc64 -pe make 3 --

       will request 3 parallel _m_a_k_e tasks to be executed on hosts of architec-
       ture "sol-sparc64". The submit may be done on a host of  any  architec-
       ture.

       The shell script

              #!/bin/sh
              qmake -inherit --

       can be submitted by

              qsub -cwd -v PATH -pe make 1-10 [further sge options] <script>

       _Q_m_a_k_e  will  inherit  the resources granted for the job submitted above
       under parallel environment "make".

       SSGGEE__RROOOOTT       Specifies the location of the Grid Engine standard  con-
                      figuration files.

       SSGGEE__CCEELLLL       If  set,  specifies  the  default  Grid  Engine cell. To
                      address a Grid Engine cell _q_m_a_k_e uses (in the  order  of
                      precedence):

                             The name of the cell specified in the environment
                             variable SGE_CELL, if it is set.

                             The name of the default cell, i.e. ddeeffaauulltt.


       SSGGEE__DDEEBBUUGG__LLEEVVEELL
                      If set, specifies that debug information should be writ-
                      ten  to stderr. In addition the level of detail in which
                      debug information is generated is defined.

       SSGGEE__AARRCCHH       The architecture of the submit host. If this variable is
                      set  in  the  submission environment, qmake will request
                      the given architecture for job execution  (see  DESCRIP-
                      TION above).

       Very  low  file  server  performance  may lead to problems on dependent
       files.

       Example: Host a compiles a.c to a.o, host b compiles b.c to b.o, host c
       shall  link program c from a.o and b.o. In case of very bad NFS perfor-
       mance, host c might not yet see files a.o and b.o.

       If multiple commands are executed in one  rule,  the  makefile  has  to
       ensure that they are handled as one command line.

       Example:

              libx.a:
                     cc -c x.c
                     ar ru libx.a x.o

       Building libx.a will fail if the commands are executed in parallel (and
       possibly on different hosts). Write the following instead:

              libx.a:
                     cc -c x.c ; ar ru libx.a x.o

       or

              libx.a:
                     cc -c x.c ; \
                     ar ru libx.a x.o
