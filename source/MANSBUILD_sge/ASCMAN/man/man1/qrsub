DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       _Q_r_s_u_b provides a means for operators, managers or users  referenced  in
       the ACL (see _a_c_c_e_s_s___l_i_s_t(5)) "aarruusseerrss" to create an Advance Reservation
       (AR) in the Grid Engine queuing system. ARs allow reserving  particular
       consumable  resources for future use. These reserved resources are only
       available for jobs requesting the AR, and  the  scheduler  ensures  the
       availability  of  the  resources  when  the start time is reached. Jobs
       requesting the AR can only use the reserved consumable resources.

       During AR submit time the Grid Engine queuing system selects  the  best
       suited  queues  for the AR request and then reserves the desired amount
       of resources.  For a reservation, all queues that are not  in  orphaned
       state are considered as suited. Only if the AR request can be fulfilled
       will the AR be granted.

       ARs will be deleted either automatically when the end time is  reached,
       or  manually  using _q_r_d_e_l(1).  In both cases, first all jobs requesting
       the AR will be removed and then the AR itself. Already granted ARs  can
       be shown with _q_r_s_t_a_t(1).

       Note: To make AR behavior predictable, it is necessary to have reserved
       resources available at the time of AR start. This is  done  by  keeping
       jobs with a unlimited runtime limit separated from ARs, and not consid-
       ering resources used by such jobs for reservation.

       Note: Resource Quotas are not considered for AR  queue  selection,  nor
       for jobs requesting an AR.

       When  an  AR  was  successfully added to the Grid Engine queuing system
       _q_r_s_u_b returns a unique integer ID referring to the  the  newly  created
       AR. The highest AR ID is 9999999. If the highest ID is reached, a wrap-
       around happens and the next unused ID, starting with 1, will be used.

       For _q_r_s_u_b, the administrator and the user may  define  default  request
       files  (analogous  to  Grid Engine_request for qsub), which can contain
       any of the possible command line options.
       A cluster wide default request file is optional.   If  such  a  default
       request file is used, it must be placed under
       $SGE_ROOT/$SGE_CELL/common/sge_ar_request (global defaults file).
       A user private default request file is optional. If it is used, it must
       be placed under
       $HOME/.sge_ar_request (user private defaults file).

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       --aa ddaattee__ttiimmee
              Defines the activation (start) date and  time  of  an  AR.   The
              option  is  not  mandatory. If omitted, the current date_time is
              assumed. Either a duration or end date_time must also be  speci-
              fied. For details about date_time please see _s_g_e___t_y_p_e_s(1).

       --AA aaccccoouunntt__ssttrriinngg
              Identifies  the account to which the resource reservation of the
              AR should be charged. For "aaccccoouunntt__ssttrriinngg" value details  please
              see  the  "nnaammee"  definition in _s_g_e___t_y_p_e_s(1).  In the absence of
              this parameter Grid Engine will place the default account string
              "sge" in the accounting record of the AR.

       --cckkpptt cckkpptt__nnaammee
              Selects the checkpointing environment (see _c_h_e_c_k_p_o_i_n_t(5)) the AR
              jobs may request. Using this option guarantees that only  queues
              providing this checkpoint environment will be reserved.

       --dd ttiimmee
              Defines the duration of the AR. The use of "--dd ttiimmee" is optional
              if "--ee ddaattee__ttiimmee" is requested.  For details about  "ttiimmee" defi-
              nition please see _s_g_e___t_y_p_e_s(1).

       --ee ddaattee__ttiimmee
              Defines  the  end  date  and  time  of  an  AR.  The  use of "--ee
              ddaattee__ttiimmee" is optional if "--dd ttiimmee" is requested.   For  details
              about "ddaattee__ttiimmee" definition please see _s_g_e___t_y_p_e_s(1).

       --hhee yy[[eess]]||nn[[oo]]
              Specifies the behavior when the AR goes into an error state. The
              AR goes into error state when a reserved host goes into  unknown
              state,  a  queue  error  happens, or when a queue is disabled or
              suspended.

              A hard error, "--hhee yyeess", means as long as the  AR  is  in  error
              state  no  jobs  using the AR will be scheduled.  If soft error,
              "--hhee nnoo", is specified the AR stays usable  with  the  remaining
              resources.
              By default soft error handling is used.


       --hheellpp  Prints a list of all options.

       --ll rreessoouurrccee==vvaalluuee,...
              Creates  an  AR  in  a  Grid  Engine  queue, providing the given
              resource request list.   _c_o_m_p_l_e_x(5)  describes  how  a  list  of
              available  resources and their associated valid value specifiers
              can be obtained.
              There may be multiple --ll switches in a single command.

       --mm bb||ee||aa||nn
              Defines or redefines under which circumstances  mail  is  to  be
              sent  to the AR owner or to the users defined with the --MM option
              described below. The option arguments have the  following  mean-
              ing:

              `b'     Mail is sent at the beginning of the AR
              `e'     Mail is sent at the end of the AR
              `a'     Mail is sent when the AR goes into error state
              `n'     No mail is sent, default for _q_r_s_u_b

       --MM uusseerr[[@@hhoosstt]],,......
              Defines  or  redefines  the  list  of users to which the qmaster
              sends mail.

       --mmaasstteerrqq wwcc__qquueeuuee__lliisstt
              Only meaningful for a parallel AR request together with the  -pe
              option.

              This  option  is used to reserve the proper queues to match this
              request if it would be requested by a  qsub.   A  more  detailed
              description of _w_c___q_u_e_u_e___l_i_s_t can be found in _s_g_e___t_y_p_e_s(1).

       --nnooww yy[[eess]]||nn[[oo]]
              This option affects the queue selection for reservation.
              With  the  "--nnooww yy" option, only queues with the qtype "INTERAC-
              TIVE" assigned will be considered for reservation.  "--nnooww nn"  is
              the default for _q_r_s_u_b.

       --NN nnaammee
              The  name  of  the  AR.  The name, if requested, must conform to
              "nnaammee" as defined in _s_g_e___t_y_p_e_s(1).  Invalid names will be denied
              at submit time.

       --ww ee||vv Specifies the validation level applied to the AR request.

              The specifiers e and v define the following validation modes:

              `v'  verify - does not submit the AR but prints
                   an extensive validation report
              `e'  error - rejects request if requirements cannot
                   be fulfilled, default for _q_r_s_u_b

       --ppee ppaarraalllleell__eennvv nn[[--[[mm]]]]||[[--]]mm,,......
              Parallel programming environment (PE) to select for the AR queue
              reservation.  Please see the details of a PE in _s_g_e___p_e(5).

       --qq wwcc__qquueeuuee__lliisstt
              Defines or redefines a list of cluster queues, queue domains  or
              queue  instances  that  may be reserved by the AR. Please find a
              description of _w_c___q_u_e_u_e___l_i_s_t in  _s_g_e___t_y_p_e_s(1).   This  parameter
              has  all the properties of a resource request and will be merged
              with requirements derived from the --ll option described above.

       --uu [[uusseerrnnaammee||@@aacccceessss__lliisstt]],,......
              Defines the users allowed to submit jobs requesting the AR.  The
              access  is  specified  by a comma-separated list containing UNIX
              users or ACLs (see _a_c_c_e_s_s___l_i_s_t(5)).  An  ACL  is  differentiated
              from  a  UNIX  user  name  by prefixing the ACL name with an '@'
              sign.
              By default only the AR owner is allowed to submit jobs  request-
              ing the AR.

              Note:  Only  queues  where  all users specified in the list have
              access are considered for reservation (see _q_u_e_u_e___c_o_n_f(5)).

EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTTAALL VVAARRIIAABBLLEESS
       SSGGEE__RROOOOTT       Specifies the location of the Grid Engine standard  con-
                      figuration files.

       SSGGEE__CCEELLLL       If  set,  specifies  the  default  Grid  Engine cell. To
                      address a Grid Engine cell, _q_s_u_b, _q_s_h, _q_l_o_g_i_n or  _q_a_l_t_e_r
                      use (in the order of precedence):

                             The name of the cell specified in the environment
                             variable SGE_CELL, if it is set.

                             The name of the default cell, i.e. ddeeffaauulltt.

       SSGGEE__DDEEBBUUGG__LLEEVVEELL
                      If set, specifies that debug information should be writ-
                      ten  to stderr. In addition the level of detail in which
                      debug information is generated is defined.

       SSGGEE__QQMMAASSTTEERR__PPOORRTT
                      If set, specifies the TCP port on  which  _s_g_e___q_m_a_s_t_e_r(8)
                      is  expected to listen for communication requests.  Most
                      installations will use a services map entry for the ser-
                      vice "sge_qmaster" instead of defining the port.
