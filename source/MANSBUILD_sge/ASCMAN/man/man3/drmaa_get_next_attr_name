       DRMAA  job  template  attributes can be set from six different sources.
       In order of precedence, from lowest to highest, these are: options  set
       by  DRMAA  automatically  by default, options set in the _s_g_e___r_e_q_u_e_s_t(5)
       file(s),  options  set  in  the  script  file,  options  set   by   the
       drmaa_job_category  attribute, options set by the drmaa_native_specifi-
       cation attribute, and options set through other DRMAA attributes.

       By default DRMAA sets four options for all jobs.  These are "-p 0", "-b
       yes",  "-shell  no",  and "-w e".  This means that by default, all jobs
       will have priority 0, all jobs will  be  treated  as  binary,  i.e.  no
       scripts  args will be parsed, all jobs will be executed without a wrap-
       per shell, and jobs which are unschedulable will cause a submit error.

       The _s_g_e___r_e_q_u_e_s_t(5) file, found in the $SGE_ROOT/$SGE_CELL/common direc-
       tory,  may contain options to be applied to all jobs.  The .sge_request
       file found in the user's home directory or the current  working  direc-
       tory  may  also  contain  options  to  be applied to certain jobs.  See
       _s_g_e___r_e_q_u_e_s_t(5) for more information.

       If   the   _s_g_e___r_e_q_u_e_s_t(5)   file   contains   "-b   no"   or   if   the
       drmaa_native_specification  attribute  is set and contains "-b no", the
       script file will  be  parsed  for  in-line  arguments.   Otherwise,  no
       scripts args will be interpreted.  See _q_s_u_b(1) for more information.

       If  the drmaa_job_category attribute is set, and the category it points
       to exists in one of the _q_t_a_s_k(5) files,  the  options  associated  with
       that  category  will  be applied to the job template.  See _q_t_a_s_k(5) and
       the drmaa_job_category attribute below for more information.

       If the drmaa_native_specification attribute is set,  all  options  con-
       tained   therein  will  be  applied  to  the  job  template.   See  the
       drmaa_native_specification below for more information.

       Other DRMAA attributes will override any previous settings.  For  exam-
       ple,  if the sge_request file contains "-j y", but the drmaa_join_files
       attribute is set to "n", the ultimate result is that the input and out-
       put files will remain separate.

       For  various reasons, some options are silently ignored by DRMAA.  Set-
       ting any of these options will have no  effect.   The  ignored  options
       are:  -cwd, -help, -sync, -t, -verify, -w w, and -w v.  The -cwd option
       can   be   re-enabled   by   setting    the    environment    variable,
       SGE_DRMAA_ALLOW_CWD.   However,  the -cwd option is not thread safe and
       should not be used in a multi-threaded context.

DDRRMMAAAA JJOOBB TTEEMMPPLLAATTEE AATTTTRRIIBBUUTTEESS
   ddrrmmaaaa__rreemmoottee__ccoommmmaanndd -- ""<<rreemmoottee__ccoommmmaanndd>>""
       Specifies the remote command to execute. The _r_e_m_o_t_e___c_o_m_m_a_n_d must be the
       path of an executable that is available at the  job's  execution  host.
       If  the  path  is relative, it is assumed to be relative to the working
       directory, usually set through  the  drmaa_wd  attribute.   If  working
       directory  is not set, the path is assumed to be relative to the user's
       home directory.

       The file pointed to by  remote_command  may  either  be  an  executable
       binary  or an executable script.  If a script, it must include the path
       to the shell in a #! line at the beginning of the script.  By  default,
       the  remote  command will be executed directly, as by _e_x_e_c(2).  To have
       the remote command executed in a shell, such as to preserve environment
       settings,  use  the drmaa_native_specification attribute to include the
       "-shell yes" option.  Jobs which are executed by a wrapper  shell  fail
       differently  from  jobs  which are executed directly.  When a job which
       contains a user error, such as an invalid path to  the  executable,  is
       executed  by  a  wrapper  shell, the job will execute successfully, but
       exit with a return code of 1.  When a job which contains such an  error
       is executed directly, it will enter the DRMAA_PS_FAILED state upon exe-
       cution.

   ddrrmmaaaa__jjss__ssttaattee -- ""{{ddrrmmaaaa__hhoolldd||ddrrmmaaaa__aaccttiivvee}}""
       Specifies the job state at submission. The string  values  'drmaa_hold'
       and  'drmaa_active'  are supported. When 'drmaa_active' is used the job
       is submitted in a runnable state.  When 'drmaa_hold' is used the job is
       submitted   in   user   hold  state  (either  DRMAA_PS_USER_ON_HOLD  or
       DRMAA_PS_USER_SYSTEM_ON_HOLD). This attribute is largely equivalent  to
       the _q_s_u_b(1) submit option '-h'.

   ddrrmmaaaa__wwdd -- ""<<ddiirreeccttoorryy__nnaammee>>""
       Specifies  the  directory  name  where  the  job  will  be  executed. A
       '$drmaa_hd_ph$' placeholder at  the  beginning  of  the  _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y___n_a_m_e
       denotes  the remaining string portion as a relative directory name that
       is resolved relative to the job user's home directory at the  execution
       host.  When the DRMAA job template is used for bulk job submission (see
       also _d_r_m_a_a___r_u_n___b_u_l_k___j_o_b(3)) the '$drmaa_incr_ph$'  placeholder  can  be
       used at any position within _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y___n_a_m_e to cause a substitution with
       the parametric job's index.  The _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y___n_a_m_e must be specified in  a
       syntax  that is common at the host where the job is executed. If set to
       a relative path and no placeholder is used,  a  path  relative  to  the
       user's  home  directory  is assumed.  If not set, the working directory
       will default to the user's home directory.  If set and the given direc-
       tory  does  not exist the job will enter the DRMAA_PS_FAILED state when
       run.

       Note that the working directory path is the path on the execution host.
       If  binary  mode is disabled, an attempt to find the job script will be
       made, relative to the working directory path.  That means that the path
       to  the  script  must  be the same on both the submission and execution
       hosts.

   ddrrmmaaaa__jjoobb__nnaammee -- ""<<jjoobb__nnaammee>>""
       Specifies the job's name. Setting the job name is equivalent to use  of
       _q_s_u_b(1) submit option '-N' with _j_o_b___n_a_m_e as option argument.

   ddrrmmaaaa__iinnppuutt__ppaatthh -- ""[[<<hhoossttnnaammee>>]]::<<ffiillee__ppaatthh>>""
       Specifies  the  standard input of the job. Unless set elsewhere, if not
       explicitly set in the job template, the job is started  with  an  empty
       input  stream.  If  the  standard input is set it specifies the network
       path of the job's input stream file.

       When the 'drmaa_transfer_files' job template attribute is supported and
       contains  the  character  'i',  the  input file will be fetched by Grid
       Engine from the specified host or from the submit host if  no  _h_o_s_t_n_a_m_e
       is specified. When the 'drmaa_transfer_files' job template attribute is
       not supported or does not contain the character 'i', the input file  is
       always expected at the host where the job is executed regardless of any
       _h_o_s_t_n_a_m_e specified.

       If the DRMAA job template will be used for bulk  job  submission,  (See
       also  _d_r_m_a_a___r_u_n___b_u_l_k___j_o_b(3))  the  '$drmaa_incr_ph$' placeholder can be
       used at any position within _f_i_l_e___p_a_t_h to cause a substitution with  the
       parametric  job's index. A '$drmaa_hd_ph$' placeholder at the beginning
       of _f_i_l_e___p_a_t_h denotes the remaining portion of the _f_i_l_e___p_a_t_h as a  rela-
       tive file specification resolved relative to the job user's home direc-
       tory at the host where the file is located.  A  '$drmaa_wd_ph$'  place-
       holder  at  the beginning of _f_i_l_e___p_a_t_h denotes the remaining portion of
       the _f_i_l_e___p_a_t_h as a relative file specification resolved relative to the
       job's  working  directory  at  the  host where the file is located. The
       _f_i_l_e___p_a_t_h must be specified in a syntax that  is  common  at  the  host

       Specifies the standard output of the job. If not explicitly set in  the
       job  template,  the  whereabouts  of  the  job's  output  stream is not
       defined. If set, this attribute specifies the network path of the job's

       Specifies  the  standard error of the job. If not explicitly set in the
       job template, the whereabouts of the job's error stream is not defined.
       If  set,  this  attribute specifies the network path of the job's error
       stream file.

       When the 'drmaa_transfer_files' job template attribute is supported and

       Specifies  if the job's error stream should be intermixed with the out-
       put stream.  If not explicitly set in the job  template  the  attribute
       defaults  to  'n'. Either 'y' or 'n' can be specified. If 'y' is speci-
       fied Grid Engine will ignore the value of  the  'drmaa_error_path'  job
       template  attribute  and  intermix  the  standard error stream with the
       standard output stream as specified with 'drmaa_output_path'.

       Specifies the DRMAA job category. The _c_a_t_e_g_o_r_y string is used  by  Grid
       Engine  as  a reference into the _q_t_a_s_k(5) file. Certain _q_s_u_b(1) options
       used in the referenced qtask file line are applied to the job  template
       before  submission to allow site-specific resolving of resources and/or
       policies.  The cluster qtask file, the local qtask file, and  the  user
       qtask file are searched. Job settings resulting from job template cate-
       gory are  overridden  by  settings  resulting  from  the  job  template
       drmaa_native_specification  attribute  as well as by explicit DRMAA job
       template settings.

       In order to avoid collisions with command names in the qtask files,  it
       is  recommended  that  DRMAA  job  category names take the form: <cate-
       gory_name>.cat.

       The options -help, -sync, -t, -verify, and -w  w|v  are  ignored.   The
       -cwd  option  is  ignored  unless  the $SGE_DRMAA_ALLOW_CWD environment
       variable is set.

       Specifies Grid Engine native _q_s_u_b(1) options which will be  interpreted
       as  part  of  the DRMAA job template.  All options available to _q_s_u_b(1)
       command may be used in  the  _n_a_t_i_v_e___s_p_e_c_i_f_i_c_a_t_i_o_n,  except  for  -help,
       -sync,  -t,  -verify,  and -w w|v.  The -cwd option may only be used if
       the SGE_DRMAA_ALLOW_CWD environment variable is set.  This  is  because
       the current parsing algorithm for -cwd is not thread-safe.  Options set
       in the _n_a_t_i_v_e _s_p_e_c_i_f_i_c_a_t_i_o_n will be  overridden  by  the  corresponding
       DRMAA attributes.  See _q_s_u_b(1) for more information on qsub options.

       Specifies  the  job  environment.  Each  environment  _v_a_l_u_e defines the
       remote environment. The _v_a_l_u_e overrides the remote  environment  values

       Specifies whether e-mail sending shall  blocked  or  not.   By  default
       email  is  not  sent.  If, however, a setting in a cluster or user set-
       tings file or the 'drmaa_native_specification' or  'drmaa_job_category'
       attribute  enables  sending  email  in association with job events, the
       'drmaa_block_email' attribute will override that  setting,  causing  no
       email to be sent.

       Specifies  the  earliest  time  when  the job may be eligible to be run
       where

              CC is the first two digits of the year (century-1)
              YY is the last two digits of the year
              MM is the two digits of the month [01,12]
              DD is the two digit day of the month [01,31]
              hh is the two digit hour of the day [00,23]
              mm is the two digit minute of the day [00,59]
              ss is the two digit second of the minute [00,61]
              UU is the two digit hours since (before) UTC
              uu is the two digit minutes since (before) UTC

       If the optional UTC-offset is not specified, the offset associated with
       the  local timezone will be used. If the day (DD) is not specified, the
       current day will be used unless the specified  hour:mm:ss  has  already
       elapsed,  in which case the next day will be used.  Similarly for month
       (MM), year (YY), and century-1 (CC).  Example: The time: Sep 3  4:47:27
       PM PDT 2002, could be represented as: 2002/09/03 16:47:27 -07:00.

       Specifies,  which  of the standard I/O files (stdin, stdout and stderr)
       are to be transferred to/from the execution host. If not set,  defaults
       to  "".  Any  combination  of  'e',  'i' and 'o' may be specified.  See
       drmaa_input_path, drmaa_output_path and drmaa_error_path  for  informa-
       tion about how to specify the standard input file, standard output file
       and standard error file.  The file transfer mechanism  itself  must  be
       configured  by the administrator (see _s_g_e___c_o_n_f(5) ). When it is config-
       ured, the administrator has to enable drmaa_transfer_files.  If  it  is
       not  configured,  "drmaa_transfer_files"  is  not  enabled and can't be
       used.

                      the order of precedence):

                             The name of the cell specified in the environment
                             variable SGE_CELL, if it is set.

                             The name of the default cell, i.e. ddeeffaauulltt.
