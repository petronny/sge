       _s_g_e___s_h_e_p_h_e_r_d  provides  the  parent  process functionality for a single
       Grid Engine job.  The parent functionality is necessary on UNIX systems
       to  retrieve  resource usage information (see _g_e_t_r_u_s_a_g_e(2)) after a job
       has finished. In addition, the _s_g_e___s_h_e_p_h_e_r_d  forwards  signals  to  the
       job,  such as the signals for suspension, enabling, termination and the
       Grid Engine checkpointing signal (see _s_g_e___c_k_p_t(1) and _q_u_e_u_e___c_o_n_f(5) for
       details).

       The  _s_g_e___s_h_e_p_h_e_r_d receives information about the job to be started from
       the _s_g_e___e_x_e_c_d(8).  During the execution of the job it  actually  starts
       up  to  5 child processes. First a prolog script is run if this feature
       is enabled by the pprroolloogg parameter in the cluster  configuration.  (See
       _s_g_e___c_o_n_f(5).)   Next a parallel environment startup procedure is run if
       the job is a parallel job. (See _s_g_e___p_e(5) for more information.)  After
       that,  the  job itself is run, followed by a parallel environment shut-
       down procedure for parallel jobs,  and  finally  an  epilog  script  if
       requested  by  the  eeppiilloogg  parameter in the cluster configuration. The
       prolog and epilog scripts, as well as the parallel environment  startup
       and shutdown procedures, are to be provided by the Grid Engine adminis-
       trator and are intended for site-specific actions to  be  taken  before
       and after execution of the actual user job.

       After  the  job  has  finished  and  the  epilog  script  is processed,
       _s_g_e___s_h_e_p_h_e_r_d retrieves resource usage statistics about the job,  places
       them in a job specific subdirectory of the _s_g_e___e_x_e_c_d(8) spool directory
       for reporting through _s_g_e___e_x_e_c_d(8), and finishes.

       _s_g_e___s_h_e_p_h_e_r_d also places an exit status file in  the  spool  directory.
       This  exit  status can be viewed with qacct -j JobId (see _q_a_c_c_t(1)); it
       is not the exit status of _s_g_e___s_h_e_p_h_e_r_d itself but of one of the methods
       executed  by _s_g_e___s_h_e_p_h_e_r_d_.  This exit status can have several meanings,
       depending on the method in which an error occurred (if any).  The  pos-
       sible  methods are: prolog, parallel start, job, parallel stop, epilog,
       suspend, restart, terminate, clean, migrate, and checkpoint.

       The following exit values are returned:

       0      All methods: Operation was executed successfully.

       99     Job script, prolog and epilog: When _F_O_R_B_I_D___R_E_S_C_H_E_D_U_L_E is not set
              in  the configuration (see _s_g_e___c_o_n_f(5)), the job gets re-queued.
              Otherwise see "Other".

       100    Job script, prolog and epilog: When _F_O_R_B_I_D___A_P_P_E_R_R_O_R is  not  set
              in  the configuration (see _s_g_e___c_o_n_f(5)), the job gets re-queued.
              Otherwise see "Other".

       Other  Job script: This is the exit status of the job itself. No action
              is  taken upon this exit status because the meaning of this exit
              status is not known.
              Prolog, epilog and parallel start: The queue  is  set  to  error
              state and the job is re-queued.
              Parallel  stop:  The queue is set to error state, but the job is
              not re-queued. It is assumed that the job  itself  ran  success-
              fully and only the clean up script failed.
              Suspend, restart, terminate, clean, and migrate: Always success-
              ful.
              Checkpoint: Success, except for kernel checkpointing: checkpoint
              was not successful, did not happen (but migration will happen by
              Grid Engine).
