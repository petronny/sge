       _s_g_e___e_x_e_c_d controls the Grid Engine queues local to the machine on which
       _s_g_e___e_x_e_c_d is running and executes/controls the jobs sent from _s_g_e___q_m_a_s_-
       _t_e_r(8) to be run on these queues.

LLOOAADD SSEENNSSOORRSS
       If a llooaadd sseennssoorr is configured for _s_g_e___e_x_e_c_d via either the global host
       configuration or the execution-host-specific cluster configuration (see
       _s_g_e___c_o_n_f(5)),  the  executable  path  of  the load sensor is invoked by
       _s_g_e___e_x_e_c_d on a regular basis and delivers one or multiple load  figures
       for  the  execution  host (e.g.  users currently logged in) or the com-
       plete cluster (e.g. free disk space on a network wide scratch file sys-
       tem). The load sensor may be a script or a binary executable. In either
       case its handling of the STDIN and STDOUT streams and its control  flow
       must comply to the following rules:

       The  load  sensor must be written as an infinite loop waiting at a cer-
       tain point for input from STDIN. If the  string  "quit"  is  read  from
       STDIN,  the  load sensor should exit.  When an end-of-line is read from
       STDIN, a load data retrieval cycle should start. The load  sensor  then
       performs  whatever  operation  is necessary to compute the desired load
       figures.  At the end of the cycle the load sensor writes the result  to
       stdout. The format is as follows:

       +o  A  load  value  report starts with a line containing only either the
          word  "start" or the word "begin".

       +o  Individual load values are separated by newlines.

       +o  Each load value report consists of three parts separated  by  colons
          (":") and containing no blanks.

       +o  The first part of a load value information is either the name of the
          host for which load is reported or the special name "global".

       +o  The second part is the symbolic name of the load value as defined in
          the  host  or global complex list (see _c_o_m_p_l_e_x(5) for details). If a
          load value is reported for which no entry in the host or global com-
          plex list exists, the reported load value is not used.

       +o  The third part is the measured load value.

       +o  A load value report ends with a line with only the word "end".

       SSGGEE__RROOOOTT       Specifies  the location of the Grid Engine standard con-
                      figuration files.

       SSGGEE__CCEELLLL       If set, specifies  the  default  Grid  Engine  cell.  To
                      address  a Grid Engine cell _s_g_e___e_x_e_c_d uses (in the order
                      of precedence):

                             The name of the cell specified in the environment
                             variable SGE_CELL, if it is set.

                             The name of the default cell, i.e. ddeeffaauulltt.


       SSGGEE__DDEEBBUUGG__LLEEVVEELL
                      If set, specifies that debug information should be writ-
                      ten to stderr. In addition the level of detail in  which
                      debug information is generated is defined.

       SSGGEE__QQMMAASSTTEERR__PPOORRTT
                      If  set,  specifies the tcp port on which _s_g_e___q_m_a_s_t_e_r(8)
                      is expected to listen for communication requests.   Most
                      installations will use a services map entry for the ser-
                      vice "sge_qmaster" instead to define that port.

       SSGGEE__EEXXEECCDD__PPOORRTT If set, specifies the tcp port on which _s_g_e___e_x_e_c_d(8)  is
                      expected  to  listen  for  communication requests.  Most
                      installations will use a services map entry for the ser-
                      vice "sge_execd" instead to define that port.

RREESSTTRRIICCTTIIOONNSS
       _s_g_e___e_x_e_c_d  usually  is  started  from  root on each machine in the Grid
       Engine pool.  If started by a normal user, a spool  directory  must  be
       used  to  which  the user has read/write access. In this case only jobs
       being submitted by that same user are handled correctly by the system.

FFIILLEESS
       ssggeeppaasssswwdd  contains  a  list  of  user  names   and   their correspond-
       ing  encrypted  passwords.  If  available, the password  file  will  be
       used   by  ssggee__eexxeeccdd. To change the contents of this  file  please  use
