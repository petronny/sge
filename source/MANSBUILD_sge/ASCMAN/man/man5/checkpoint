       checkpoint  -  Grid Engine checkpointing environment configuration file
       format

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       Checkpointing is a facility to save the complete status of an executing
       program  or  job  and to restore and restart from this so-called check-
       point at a later point of time if  the  original  program  or  job  was
       halted, e.g.  through a system crash.

       Grid  Engine  provides  various  levels  of  checkpointing support (see
       _s_g_e___c_k_p_t(1)).  The checkpointing environment described here is a  means
       to  configure the different types of checkpointing in use for your Grid
       Engine cluster or parts thereof. For that purpose you  can  define  the
       operations which have to be executed in initiating a checkpoint genera-
       tion, a migration of a checkpoint to another host, or a  restart  of  a
       checkpointed  application, as well as the list of queues which are eli-
       gible for a checkpointing method.

       Supporting different operating systems may easily force Grid Engine  to
       introduce  operating  system  dependencies for the configuration of the
       checkpointing configuration file and updates of the supported operating
       system versions may lead to frequently changing implementation details.
       Please refer to the <sge_root>/ckpt directory for more information.

       Please use the _-_a_c_k_p_t, _-_d_c_k_p_t, _-_m_c_k_p_t or _-_s_c_k_p_t options to the _q_c_o_n_f(1)
       command  to manipulate checkpointing environments from the command-line
       or use the corresponding _q_m_o_n(1) dialogue for X-Windows based  interac-
       tive configuration.

       Note,  Grid  Engine  allows  backslashes  (\) be used to escape newline
       characters. The backslash and the newline are  replaced  with  a  space
       character before any interpretation.

       The format of a _c_h_e_c_k_p_o_i_n_t file is defined as follows:

   cckkpptt__nnaammee
       The  name  of the checkpointing environment in the format for _c_k_p_t___n_a_m_e
       in _s_g_e___t_y_p_e_s(1).  To be used in the _q_s_u_b(1) --cckkpptt  switch  or  for  the
       _q_c_o_n_f(1) options mentioned above.

   iinntteerrffaaccee
       The  type  of  checkpointing to be used. Currently, the following types
       are valid:

       _h_i_b_e_r_n_a_t_o_r
              The Hibernator kernel level checkpointing is interfaced.

       _c_p_r    The SGI kernel level checkpointing is used.

       _c_r_a_y_-_c_k_p_t
              The Cray kernel level checkpointing is assumed.

       _t_r_a_n_s_p_a_r_e_n_t
              Grid Engine assumes that the jobs submitted  with  reference  to
              this checkpointing interface use a checkpointing library such as
              provided by the free package _C_o_n_d_o_r.

       _u_s_e_r_d_e_f_i_n_e_d
              Grid Engine assumes that the jobs submitted  with  reference  to
              this checkpointing interface perform their private checkpointing
              method.

       _a_p_p_l_i_c_a_t_i_o_n_-_l_e_v_e_l
              Uses all of the interface commands configured in the checkpoint-
              ing  object  like  in the case of one of the kernel level check-
              pointing  interfaces  (_c_p_r,  _c_r_a_y_-_c_k_p_t,  etc.)  except  for  the
              rreessttaarrtt__ccoommmmaanndd  (see  below),  which is not used (even if it is
              configured) but the job script is invoked in case of  a  restart
              instead.

   cckkpptt__ccoommmmaanndd
       A  command-line  type  command  string to be executed by Grid Engine in
       order to initiate a checkpoint.

   mmiiggrr__ccoommmmaanndd
       A command-line type command string to be executed by Grid Engine during
       a migration of a checkpointing job from one host to another.

   rreessttaarrtt__ccoommmmaanndd
       A  command-line  type command string to be executed by Grid Engine when
       restarting a previously checkpointed application.

   cclleeaann__ccoommmmaanndd
       A command-line type command string to be executed  by  Grid  Engine  in
       order to cleanup after a checkpointed application has finished.

   cckkpptt__ddiirr
       A file system location to which checkpoints of potentially considerable
       size should be stored.

   cckkpptt__ssiiggnnaall
       A Unix signal to be sent to a job by Grid Engine to initiate checkpoint
       generation. The value for this field can either be a symbolic name from
       the list produced by the _-_l option of the _k_i_l_l(1) command or an integer
       number which must be a valid signal on the systems used for checkpoint-
       ing.

   wwhheenn
       The points of time when  checkpoints  are  expected  to  be  generated.
       Valid  values for this parameter are composed from the letters _s, _m, _x,
       _r and any combinations thereof  without  any  separating  character  in
       between.  The same letters are allowed for the _-_c option of the _q_s_u_b(1)
       command which will overwrite the definitions in the used  checkpointing
       environment.  The meaning of the letters is defined as follows:

       _s      A  job  is checkpointed, aborted and if possible migrated if the
              corresponding _s_g_e___e_x_e_c_d(8) is shut down on the job's machine.

       _m      Checkpoints are generated periodically at  the  _m_i_n___c_p_u___i_n_t_e_r_v_a_l
              interval defined by the queue (see _q_u_e_u_e___c_o_n_f(5)) in which a job
              executes.

       _x      A job is checkpointed, aborted and,  if  possible,  migrated  as
              soon  as  the  job gets suspended (manually as well as automati-
              cally).

       _r      A job will be rescheduled (not checkpointed) when  the  host  on
              which  the  job currently runs went into the "unknown" state and
              the time interval _r_e_s_c_h_e_d_u_l_e___u_n_k_n_o_w_n (see  _s_g_e___c_o_n_f(5))  defined
              in the global/local cluster configuration is exceeded.


RREESSTTRRIICCTTIIOONNSS
       NNoottee  that the functionality of any checkpointing, migration or restart
       procedures provided by default with the Grid  Engine  distribution,  as
       well  as the way how they are invoked in the _c_k_p_t___c_o_m_m_a_n_d, _m_i_g_r___c_o_m_m_a_n_d
       or _r_e_s_t_a_r_t___c_o_m_m_a_n_d parameters of  any  default  checkpointing  environ-
       ments,  should  not be changed; otherwise the functionality remains the
       full responsibility of the administrator configuring the  checkpointing
       environment.   Grid Engine will just invoke these procedures and evalu-
       ate their exit status. If the procedures do  not  perform  their  tasks
       properly,  or  are  not  invoked in a proper fashion, the checkpointing
       mechanism may behave unexpectedly; Grid Engine has no means  to  detect
       this.
