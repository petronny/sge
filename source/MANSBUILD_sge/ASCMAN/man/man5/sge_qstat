       sge_qstat - Grid Engine default qstat file format

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       _s_g_e___q_s_t_a_t  defines the command line switches that will be used by qstat
       by default.  If available, the default sge_qstat file is read and  pro-
       cessed by _q_s_t_a_t(1).

       There  is  a cluster global and a user private sge_qstat file. The user
       private file has the highest precedence and is followed by the  cluster
       global  sge_qstat  file. Command line switches used with _q_s_t_a_t(1) over-
       ride all switches contained in  the  user  private  or  cluster  global
       sge_qstat file.

       The format of the default files is:

       +o  The default sge_qstat file may contain an arbitrary number of lines.
          Blank lines and lines with a  '#'  sign  in  the  first  column  are
          skipped.   Each  line  not  to  be  skipped may contain any _q_s_t_a_t(1)
          option as described in the Grid Engine Reference Manual.  More  than
          one option per line is allowed.

       The following is a simple example of a default sge_qstat file:

       =====================================================
       # Just show me my own running and suspended jobs
       -s rs -u $user
       =====================================================


       Having  defined  a  default sge_qstat file like this and using qstat as
       follows:

       qstat

       has the same effect as if qstat was executed with:

       qstat -s rs -u <current_user>
       (Note that -u $user is now the default behaviour.)
