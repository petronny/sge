       sge_aliases - Grid Engine path aliases file format

       The  Grid  Engine  path  aliasing  facility provides administrators and
       users with the means to reflect complicated and inhomogeneous file sys-
       tem  structures in distributed environments (such as user home directo-
       ries mounted under different paths on different hosts)  and  to  ensure
       that  Grid Engine is able to locate the appropriate working directories
       for executing batch jobs.

       There is a system global path aliasing  file  and  a  user-local  file.
       _s_g_e___a_l_i_a_s_e_s defines the format of both:

       +o  Blank  lines,  and  lines  with  a '#' sign in the first column, are
          skipped.

       +o  Each line other than a blank line or a line with a leading  '#'  has
          to contain four strings separated by any number of blanks or tabs.

       +o  The  first string specifies a source path, the second a submit host,
          the third an execution host, and the fourth the source path replace-
          ment.

       +o  Both the submit and the execution host entries may consist of only a
          '*' sign which matches any host.

       If the _q_s_u_b(1)
        _-_c_w_d flag is specified (and only if - otherwise the user's home direc-
       tory  on  the  execution host is selected to execute the job), the path
       aliasing mechanism is activated, and the files are  processed  as  fol-
       lows:

       +o  After  _q_s_u_b(1)  has retrieved the physical current working directory
          path, the cluster global path aliasing file is read, if present. The
          user  path aliases file is read afterwards as if it were appended to
          the global file.

       +o  Lines not to be skipped are read from the top of the file one by one
          while the translations specified by those lines are stored if neces-
          sary.

       +o  A translation is stored only if the submit host  entry  matches  the
          host _q_s_u_b(1) is executed on and if the source path forms the initial
          part of either the current working directory or of the  source  path
          replacements already stored.

       +o  As soon as both files are read the stored, path aliasing information
          is passed along with the submitted job.

       +o  On the execution host, the aliasing information will  be  evaluated.
          The  leading  part of the current working directory will be replaced
          by the source-path replacement if the execution-host  entry  of  the
          path  alias  matches  the  executing host. NNoottee:: The current working
          directory string will be changed in this case, and  subsequent  path
          aliases  must  match  the  replaced  working  directory  path  to be
          applied.

       The following is a simple example of a  path  aliasing  file  resolving
       problems with inhomogeneous paths if _a_u_t_o_m_o_u_n_t(8) is used:

       =====================================================
       # Path Aliasing File
       # src-path   sub-host   exec-host   replacement
       /tmp_mnt/    *          *           /
       # replaces any occurrence of /tmp_mnt/ by /
       # if submitting or executing on any host.
       # Thus paths on nfs server and clients are the same
       =====================================================
