       bootstrap - Grid Engine bootstrap file

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       _b_o_o_t_s_t_r_a_p  contains  parameters that are needed for the startup of Grid
       Engine components.  It is created during the sge_qmaster  installation.
       Modifying _b_o_o_t_s_t_r_a_p in a running system is not supported.

FFOORRMMAATT
       The paragraphs that follow provide brief descriptions of the individual
       parameters that comprise the bootstrap configuration for a Grid  Engine
       cluster:

   aaddmmiinn__uusseerr
       Administrative  user  account used by Grid Engine for all internal file
       handling (status spooling, message logging, etc.). Can be used in cases
       where the root account does not have the corresponding file access per-
       missions (e.g. on a shared file system without global  root  read/write
       access).

       As  a parameter set at installation time, changing aaddmmiinn__uusseerr in a run-
       ning system is not supported. Changing it manually on a shut-down clus-
       ter  is  possible,  but  if  access to the Grid Engine spooling area is
       interrupted, this will result in unpredictable behavior.

       The aaddmmiinn__uusseerr parameter has  no  default  value,  but  instead  it  is
       defined during the master installation procedure.

   ddeeffaauulltt__ddoommaaiinn
       Only  needed if your Grid Engine cluster covers hosts belonging to more
       than a single DNS domain. In this case it can be used if your  hostname
       resolving yields both qualified and unqualified hostnames for the hosts
       in one of the DNS domains.  The value of ddeeffaauulltt__ddoommaaiinn is appended  to
       the  unqualified  hostname  to  define a fully qualified hostname.  The
       ddeeffaauulltt__ddoommaaiinn parameter will have no effect if iiggnnoorree__ffqqddnn is  set  to
       "true".

       As  a  parameter set at installation time, changing ddeeffaauulltt__ddoommaaiinn in a
       running system is not supported.  The  default  for  ddeeffaauulltt__ddoommaaiinn  is
       "none", in which case it will not be used.

   iiggnnoorree__ffqqddnn
       Ignore  fully  qualified  domain name component of hostnames. Should be
       set if all hosts belonging to a Grid Engine cluster are part of a  sin-
       gle  DNS  domain.  It  is  switched  on if set to either "true" or "1".
       Switching it on may solve problems with load reports due  to  different
       hostname resolutions across the cluster.

       As a parameter set at installation time, changing iiggnnoorree__ffqqddnn in a run-
       ning system is not supported. The default for iiggnnoorree__ffqqddnn is "true".

   ssppoooolliinngg__mmeetthhoodd
       Defines how _s_g_e___q_m_a_s_t_e_r(8) writes  its  configuration  and  the  status
       information of a running cluster.

       The available spooling methods are _b_e_r_k_e_l_e_y_d_b and _c_l_a_s_s_i_c.

   ssppoooolliinngg__lliibb
       The  name  of  a  shared  library  containing the ssppoooolliinngg__mmeetthhoodd to be
       loaded at _s_g_e___q_m_a_s_t_e_r(8) initialization time.  The extension character-
       izing  a  shared  library  (.so,  .sl, .dylib etc.) is not contained in
       ssppoooolliinngg__lliibb.

       If ssppoooolliinngg__mmeetthhoodd was set to _b_e_r_k_e_l_e_y_d_b  during  installation,  ssppooooll--
       iinngg__lliibb  is  set  to  _l_i_b_s_p_o_o_l_b,  and  if  _c_l_a_s_s_i_c was chosen as ssppooooll--
       iinngg__mmeetthhoodd, ssppoooolliinngg__lliibb is set to _l_i_b_s_p_o_o_l_c.

       Not all operating systems allow the dynamic loading  of  libraries.  On
       these platforms a certain spooling method (default: berkeleydb) is com-
       piled into the binaries and the parameter ssppoooolliinngg__lliibb will be ignored.

   ssppoooolliinngg__ppaarraammss
       Defines parameters of the chosen spooling method  that  are  needed  to
       initialize  the  spooling  framework, e.g. to open database files or to
       connect to a certain database server.

       The  spooling  parameters  value  for  spooling  method  _b_e_r_k_e_l_e_y_d_b  is
       [rpc_server:]database  directory,  e.g.  /sge_local/default/spool/qmas-
       ter/spooldb for spooling to  a  local  filesystem,  or  myhost:sge  for
       spooling over a Berkeley DB RPC server.

       For spooling method _c_l_a_s_s_i_c the spooling parameters take the form <com-
       mon_dir>;<qmaster     spool     dir>,      e.g.       /sge/default/com-
       mon;/sge/default/spool/qmaster

   bbiinnaarryy__ppaatthh
       The  directory  path  where the Grid Engine binaries reside. It is used
       within Grid Engine components to locate and startup other  Grid  Engine
       programs.

       The path name given here is searched for binaries as well as any direc-
       tory below with a directory name equal to the current operating  system
       architecture.  Therefore, /usr/SGE/bin will work for all architectures,
       if the corresponding  binaries  are  located  in  subdirectories  named
       aix43, lx-amd64, lx-x86, hp11, hp11-64, sol-amd64, sol-sparc etc.

       The default location for the binary path is <sge_root>/bin

   qqmmaasstteerr__ssppooooll__ddiirr
       The  location  where  the  master  spool  directory  resides.  Only the
       _s_g_e___q_m_a_s_t_e_r(8) and _s_g_e___s_h_a_d_o_w_d(8) need to have access  to  this  direc-
       tory.   The  master  spool  directory  -  in particular the job_scripts
       directory and the messages log file - may become quite large, depending
       on  the size of the cluster and the number of jobs. Be sure to allocate
       enough disk space and regularly clean off the log  files,  e.g.  via  a
       _c_r_o_n(8) job.

       As  a parameter set at installation time, changing qqmmaasstteerr__ssppooooll__ddiirr in
       a running system is not supported.

       The   default   location   for   the   master   spool   directory    is
       <sge_root>/<cell>/spool/qmaster.

   sseeccuurriittyy__mmooddee
       The  security  mode  defines the set of security features the installed
       cluster is using.

       Possible security mode settings are none, afs, dce, kerberos,  csp  (no
       additional security, AFS, DCE, KERBEROS, CSP security model).

   lliisstteenneerr__tthhrreeaaddss
       The number of listener threads (defaults set by installation).

   wwoorrkkeerr__tthhrreeaaddss
       The number of worker threads (defaults set by installation).

   sscchheedduulleerr__tthhrreeaaddss
       The number of scheduler threads (allowed: 0-1, default set by installa-
       tion: 1, off: 0).  (see _q_c_o_n_f(1) -kt/-at option)

   jjvvmm__tthhrreeaaddss
       The number of JVM threads (allowed: 0-1, default set  by  installation,
       off: 0).
