NNAAMMEE
       calendar_conf - Grid Engine calendar configuration file format

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       _c_a_l_e_n_d_a_r___c_o_n_f defines the format of the Grid Engine calendar configura-
       tion. The definition of calendars is used to specify "on duty" and "off
       duty"  time  periods  for  Grid  Engine queues on a time of day, day of
       week, or day of year basis. Various calendars can be  implemented,  and
       the  appropriate calendar definition for a certain class of jobs can be
       attached to a queue.

       _c_a_l_e_n_d_a_r___c_o_n_f entries can be added, modified  and  displayed  with  the
       _-_A_c_a_l,  _-_a_c_a_l,  _-_M_c_a_l,  _-_m_c_a_l,  _-_s_c_a_l and _-_s_c_a_l_l options to _q_c_o_n_f(1) or
       with the calendar configuration dialog of the graphical user  interface
       _q_m_o_n(1).

       Note,  Grid Engine allows backslashes (\) to escape newline characters.
       The backslash and the newline are replaced with a space (" ") character
       before any interpretation.

FFOORRMMAATT
   ccaalleennddaarr__nnaammee
       The  name  of  the  calendar to be used when attaching it to queues, or
       when  administering  the  calendar  definition.  See  _c_a_l_e_n_d_a_r___n_a_m_e  in
       _s_g_e___t_y_p_e_s(1) for a precise definition of valid calendar names.

   yyeeaarr
       The queue status definition on a day of the year basis. This field gen-
       erally will specify on which days of a year (and  optionally  at  which
       times  on  those days) a queue, to which the calendar is attached, will
       change to a certain state. The syntax of the yyeeaarr field is  defined  as
       follows:

       yyeeaarr:=
           { NONE
           | yyeeaarr__ddaayy__rraannggee__lliisstt==ddaayyttiimmee__rraannggee__lliisstt[==ssttaattee]

           | state}

       Where

       +o  NONE means, no definition is made on the year basis;

       +o  If  a  definition  is  made  on  the  year  basis,  at  least one of
          yyeeaarr__ddaayy__rraannggee__lliisstt, ddaayyttiimmee__rraannggee__lliisstt and ssttaattee always have to  be
          present;

       +o  All day long is assumed if ddaayyttiimmee__rraannggee__lliisstt is omitted;

       +o  Switching the queue to "off" (i.e. disabling it) is assumed if ssttaattee
          is omitted;

       +o  The queue is assumed to  be  enabled  for  days  neither  referenced
          implicitly (by omitting the yyeeaarr__ddaayy__rraannggee__lliisstt) nor explicitly.

       and the syntactical components are defined as follows:

         yyeeaarr__ddaayy__rraannggee__lliisstt := {yyeeaarrddaayy-yyeeaarrddaayy|yyeeaarrddaayy},...
         ddaayyttiimmee__rraannggee__lliisstt :=  hour[:minute][:second]-
                                hour[:minute][:second],...
         ssttaattee :=     {on|off|suspended}
         yyeeaarr__ddaayy :=  mmoonntthh__ddaayy..mmoonntthh..yyeeaarr
         mmoonntthh__ddaayy := {1|2|...|31}
         mmoonntthh :=     {jan|feb|...|dec|1|2|...|12}
         yyeeaarr :=      {1970|1971|...|2037}

   wweeeekk
       The queue status definition on a day of the week basis. This field gen-
       erally will specify on which days of the week (and optionally at  which
       times  on  those  days)  a queue to which the calendar is attached will
       change to a certain state. The syntax of the wweeeekk field is  defined  as
       follows:

       wweeeekk:=
           { NONE
           | wweeeekk__ddaayy__rraannggee__lliisstt[==ddaayyttiimmee__rraannggee__lliisstt][==ssttaattee]
           | [wweeeekk__ddaayy__rraannggee__lliisstt==]ddaayyttiimmee__rraannggee__lliisstt[==ssttaattee]
           | [wweeeekk__ddaayy__rraannggee__lliisstt==][ddaayyttiimmee__rraannggee__lliisstt==]ssttaattee} ...

       where

       +o  NONE means, no definition is made on the week basis;

       +o  If  a  definition  is  made  on  the  week  basis,  at  least one of
          wweeeekk__ddaayy__rraannggee__lliisstt, ddaayyttiimmee__rraannggee__lliisstt and ssttaattee always have to  be
          present;

       +o  Every day in the week is assumed if wweeeekk__ddaayy__rraannggee__lliisstt is omitted;

       +o  Syntax  and  semantics of ddaayyttiimmee__rraannggee__lliisstt and ssttaattee are identical
          to the definition given for the year field above;

       +o  The queue is assumed to  be  enabled  for  days  neither  referenced
          implicitly (by omitting the wweeeekk__ddaayy__rraannggee__lliisstt) nor explicitly.

       and where wweeeekk__ddaayy__rraannggee__lliisstt is defined as

         wweeeekk__ddaayy__rraannggee__lliisstt := {wweeeekkddaayy-wweeeekkddaayy|wweeeekkddaayy},...
         wweeeekk__ddaayy :=  {mon|tue|wed|thu|fri|sat|sun}

       With week_day ranges the week_day identifiers must be different.

SSEEMMAANNTTIICCSS
       Successive  entries  to  the yyeeaarr and wweeeekk fields (separated by blanks)
       are combined in accordance with the following rule:

       +o  "off"-areas  are  overridden  by   overlapping   "on"-   and   "sus-
          pended"-areas and "suspended"-areas are overridden by "on"-areas.

       Hence an entry of the form

         week  12-18 tue=13-17=on

       means  that  queues referencing the corresponding calendar are disabled
       for the entire week from 12.00-18.00, with  the  exception  of  Tuesday
       between 13.00-17.00, when the queues are available.


       +o  Area  overriding  occurs  only  within  a year/week basis. If a year
          entry exists for a day, then only the year calendar  is  taken  into
          account,  and no area overriding is done with a possibly conflicting
          week area.


       +o  The second time specification in a daytime_range_list may be  before
          the first one and treated as expected. Thus an entry of the form

            year  12.03.2004=12-11=off

          causes  the queue(s) be disabled 12.03.2004 from 00:00:00 - 10:59:59
          and 12:00:00 - 23:59:59.

       $SGE_ROOT/util/resources/calendars.)

       +o  Night, weekend and public holiday calendar:

          On public holidays "night" queues are explicitly enabled. On working
          days queues are disabled between 6.00 and 20.00. Saturday and Sunday
          are implicitly handled as enabled times:

            week           mon-fri=6-20


       +o  Day calendar:

          On  public  holidays "day"-queues are disabled. On working days such
          queues are closed during the night between 20.00 and 6.00, i.e.  the
          queues  are  also  closed  on Monday from 0.00 to 6.00 and on Friday
          from 20.00 to 24.00. On Saturday and Sunday the queues are disabled.

       +o  Night, weekend and public holiday calendar with suspension:

          Essentially the same scenario as the first example  but  queues  are
          suspended instead of switching them "off".

       +o  Day calendar with suspension:

          Essentially  the same scenario as the second example, but queues are
          suspended instead of switching them "off".

       +o  Weekend calendar with suspension, ignoring public holidays:

          Settings are only done on the week basis, with no  settings  on  the
          year basis (keyword "NONE").
