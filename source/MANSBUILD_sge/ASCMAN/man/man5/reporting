REPORTING(5)               Grid Engine File Formats               REPORTING(5)



NNAAMMEE
       reporting - Grid Engine reporting file format

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       A  Grid  Engine system writes a reporting file _$_S_G_E___R_O_O_T_/_$_S_G_E___C_E_L_L_/_c_o_m_-
       _m_o_n_/_r_e_p_o_r_t_i_n_g if rreeppoorrttiinngg==ttrruuee is specified in the _s_g_e___c_o_n_f(5) rreeppoorrtt--
       iinngg__ppaarraammss.   This  occurs intervals of the fflluusshh__ttiimmee specified in the
       same place.  The reporting file contains data  that  can  be  used  for
       accounting,  monitoring and analysis purposes.  It contains information
       about the cluster (hosts,  queues,  load  values,  consumables,  etc.),
       about the jobs running in the cluster and about sharetree configuration
       and usage.  All information is time-related and events  are  dumped  to
       the  reporting  file in a configurable interval.  It allows "real time"
       monitoring of the cluster status as well as historical analysis.

FFOORRMMAATT
       The reporting file is an ASCII file.  Each line  contains  one  record,
       and  the  fields  of  a  record  are separated by a delimiter (:).  The
       reporting file contains records of different type. Each record type has
       a specific record structure.

       The first two fields are common to all reporting records:

       ttiimmee   The time when the record was created.  All time values described
              here are the number of seconds since the Unix epoch  (1970-01-01
              00:00:00 UTC).

       rreeccoorrdd ttyyppee
              Type of the accounting record.

       The different types of records and their structure are described below,
       eliding the leading ttiimmee and rreeccoorrdd ttyyppee fields in each case.

   nneeww__jjoobb
       The new_job record is written whenever a  new  job  enters  the  system
       (usually by a submission command). It has the following fields:

       ssuubbmmiissssiioonn__ttiimmee
              Time when the job was submitted.

       ttaasskk__nnuummbbeerr
              The  array  task id. Always has the value -1 for new_job records
              (as array tasks haven't been created at that stage).

       job_log  record  is  written whenever a job, an array task or a PE task
       changes status. A status change can be the transition from  pending  to
       running,  but can also be triggered by user actions, like suspension of
       a job.  It has the following fields:

       eevveenntt__ttiimmee
              Time when the event was generated.

       eevveenntt  A one word description of the event.

              The  task  id of parallel tasks. Always has the value "none" for
              new_job records.

              like scheduling jobs, executing jobs etc.).

       hhoosstt   The host from which the action was initiated  (e.g.  the  submit

              A message describing the reported action.

   aacccctt
       Records of type acct are accounting records. Normally, they are written
       whenever  a  job,  a  task of an array job, or a task of a parallel job
       terminates. However, for long running jobs an intermediate acct  record
       is created once a day after midnight. This results in multiple account-
       ing records for a particular job and allows for  fine-grained  resource
       usage monitoring over time.

       Accounting  records have the structure described in _a_c_c_o_u_n_t_i_n_g(5), with
       the addition the leading time and type fields (which are  not  used  in
       the accounting file).

   qquueeuuee
       Records  of  type  queue  contain  state  information for queues (queue
       instances).  A queue record has the following fields:

       qqnnaammee  The cluster queue name.

       hhoossttnnaammee
              The hostname of a specific queue instance.

       rreeppoorrtt__ttiimmee
              The time when a state change was triggered.

       ssttaattee  The new queue state.  The possible states are single-letter val-
              ues, as reported by _q_h_o_s_t(1) with the --qq option.

   qquueeuuee__ccoonnssuummaabbllee
       A  queue_consumable  record contains information about queue consumable
       values in addition to queue state information:

              The hostname of a specific queue instance.

       rreeppoorrtt__ttiimmee

       ccoonnssuummaabblleess
              Description of consumable  values.  Information  about  multiple
              consumables is separated by space.  A consumable description has
              the format <name>=<actual_value>=<configured value>.

       Consumables are only logged if lloogg__ccoonnssuummaabblleess==ttrruuee is specified in the

       llooaadd vvaalluueess
              Description of load values. Information about multiple load val-
              ues is separated by space.  A load  value  description  has  the
              format <name>=<actual_value>.

   hhoosstt__ccoonnssuummaabbllee

              Description  of  consumable  values.  Information about multiple
              consumables is separated by space.  A consumable description has
              the format <name>=<actual_value>=<configured value>.

       Consumables are only logged if lloogg__ccoonnssuummaabblleess==ttrruuee is specified in the
       _s_g_e___c_o_n_f(5) rreeppoorrttiinngg__ppaarraammss, or the consumable  is  specified  in  the

   sshhaarreelloogg
       The Grid Engine qmaster can dump information about sharetree configura-
       tion and use to the reporting file.  The  _s_g_e___c_o_n_f(5)  rreeppoorrttiinngg__ppaarraammss
       can  specify sshhaarreelloogg, which sets an interval in which sharetree infor-
       mation will be dumped.  It is set in the format HH:MM:SS.  A  value  of
       00:00:00  configures  qmaster not to dump sharetree information. Inter-
       vals of several minutes up to hours are sensible values for this param-
       eter.  The record contains the following fields
