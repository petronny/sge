       accounting - Grid Engine accounting file format

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       An  accounting  record  is  written  to the Grid Engine accounting file
       _$_S_G_E___R_O_O_T_/_$_S_G_E___C_E_L_L_/_c_o_m_m_o_n_/_r_e_p_o_r_t_i_n_g for each finished job if  aaccccoouunntt--
       iinngg==ttrruuee is specified in the _s_g_e___c_o_n_f(5) rreeppoorrttiinngg__ppaarraammss.  This occurs
       at intervals of the aaccccoouunnttiinngg__fflluusshh__ttiimmee specified in the same  place.
       The  accounting file is processed by _q_a_c_c_t(1) to derive accounting sta-
       tistics.

FFOORRMMAATT
       Each job is represented by a line in the accounting file. Empty  lines,
       and  lines  which  contain  one character or less are ignored by _q_a_c_c_t.
       Accounting record entries are separated by colon (':') characters.  The
       entries denote in their order of appearance:

   qqnnaammee
       Name of the cluster queue in which the job has run.

   hhoossttnnaammee
       Name of the execution host.

   ggrroouupp
       The effective group id of the job owner when executing the job.

   oowwnneerr
       Owner of the Grid Engine job.

   jjoobb__nnaammee
       Job name.

   jjoobb__nnuummbbeerr
       Job identifier (job number).

   aaccccoouunntt
       An account string as specified by the _q_s_u_b(1) or _q_a_l_t_e_r(1) --AA option.

   pprriioorriittyy
       Priority  value  assigned  to  the  job,  corresponding to the pprriioorriittyy
       parameter in the queue configuration (see _q_u_e_u_e___c_o_n_f(5)).

   ssuubbmmiissssiioonn__ttiimmee
       Submission time.

   ssttaarrtt__ttiimmee
       Start time.

   eenndd__ttiimmee
       End time.

   ffaaiilleedd
       Indicates the problem which occurred in case a job could not be started
       on the execution host (e.g. because the owner of the job did not have a
       valid account on that machine). If Grid Engine tries  to  start  a  job
       multiple times, this may lead to multiple entries in the reporting file
       corresponding to the same job ID.

   eexxiitt__ssttaattuuss
       Exit status of the job script (or Grid Engine-specific status  in  case
       of certain error conditions).  The exit status is determined by follow-
       ing the normal shell conventions.  If the command  terminates  normally
       the value of the command is its exit status.  However, in the case that
       the command exits abnormally, a value of 0200 (octal), 128 (decimal) is
       added to the value of the command to make up the exit status.

              For  example:  If a job dies through signal 9 (SIGKILL) then the
              exit status becomes 128 + 9 = 137.

   rruu__wwaallllcclloocckk
       Difference between eenndd__ttiimmee and ssttaarrtt__ttiimmee (see above).

   rruu__uuttiimmee

   rruu__iiddrrssss

       These entries follow the contents of the standard Unix rusage structure
       as  described in _g_e_t_r_u_s_a_g_e(2).  Depending on the operating system where
       the job was executed, some of the fields may be 0.

   pprroojjeecctt
       The project which was assigned to the job.

       able).

   ccaatteeggoorryy
       A  string specifying the job category.  This contains a space-separated
       pseudo options list for the sub, with components as follows:

       --UU _u_s_e_r___l_i_s_t
              An owner/group ACL list composed from  _h_o_s_t___c_o_n_f(5),  _s_g_e___p_e(5),

              _s_g_e___c_o_n_f(5) are not considered since they can only cause  a  job
              to be accepted/rejected at submit time.  Omitted if there are no
              such configuration entries.

       The i/o wait time in seconds.

   ppee__ttaasskkiidd
