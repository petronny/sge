       sge_request - Grid Engine default request definition file format

       _s_g_e___r_e_q_u_e_s_t  reflects  the format of the files defining default request
       profiles. If available, default request files are  read  and  processed
       during  job  submission,  before any submit options embedded in the job
       script, and before any options in the _q_s_u_b(1)  or  _q_s_h(1)  command-line
       are  considered. Thus, the command-line and embedded script options may
       overwrite the settings in the default request  files  (see  _q_s_u_b(1)  or
       _q_s_h(1) for details).

       There  is  a  cluster  global,  a user private, and a working directory
       local default request definition  file.  The  working  directory  local
       default  request file has the highest precedence and is followed by the
       user private and then the cluster global default request file.

       NNoottee, that the _-_c_l_e_a_r option to _q_s_u_b(1) or _q_s_h(1) can be used  to  dis-
       card  any  previous  settings at any time in a default request file, in
       the embedded script flags  or  in  a  _q_s_u_b(1)  or  _q_s_h(1)  command-line
       option.

       The format of the default request definition files is:

       +o  The  default request files may contain an arbitrary number of lines.
          Blank lines, and lines with a '#' sign  in  the  first  column,  are
          skipped.

       +o  Each  line  not  to  be skipped may contain any _q_s_u_b(1) option. More
          than one option per line is allowed. The batch script file and argu-
          ment  options  to  the  batch  script  are not considered as _q_s_u_b(1)
          options and thus are not allowed in a default request file.

       The following is a simple example of a default request definition file:

       =====================================================
       # Default Requests File

       # request group to be sun4 and a CPU-time of 5hr
       -l arch=sun4,s_cpu=5:0:0

       # don't restart the job in case of system crashes
       -r n
       =====================================================


       Having defined a default request definition file like this,  submitting
       a job as follows:

       qsub test.sh

       would have precisely the same effect as if the job was submitted with:

       qsub -l arch=sun4,s_cpu=5:0:0 -r n test.sh
