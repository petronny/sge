       host_aliases - Grid Engine host aliases file format

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       All Grid Engine components use a hostname resolving service provided by
       the communication library to identify hosts via a unique hostname.  The
       communication  library  itself  references standard UNIX directory ser-
       vices such as DNS, NIS and /etc/hosts to resolve hostnames (through the
       Name  Service Switch on systems which support it).  In rare cases these
       standard services cannot be setup cleanly and Grid Engine communication
       daemons  running  on different hosts are unable to automatically deter-
       mine a unique hostname for one or all hosts which can be  used  on  all
       hosts.  In  such situations a Grid Engine host aliases file can be used
       to provide the communication daemons  with  a  private  and  consistent
       hostname resolution database.

       The  location  for  the  host  aliases  file  is _<_s_g_e___r_o_o_t_>_/_<_c_e_l_l_>_/_c_o_m_-

       For each host a single line must be provided with a blank-, comma-,  or
       semicolon-separated  list  of  hostname  aliases.  The  first  alias is
       defined to be the uunniiqquuee hostname which will be used by all Grid Engine
       components  using  the  hostname  aliasing service of the communication
       library.
