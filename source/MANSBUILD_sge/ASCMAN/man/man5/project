       project - Grid Engine project entry file format

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       Jobs can be submitted to projects, and a project can be assigned with a
       certain level of importance, via the functional or the override policy.
       This  level of importance is then inherited by the jobs executing under
       that project.

       A list of currently  configured  projects  can  be  displayed  via  the
       _q_c_o_n_f(1)  --sspprrjjll option. The contents of each listed project definition
       can be shown via the --sspprrjj switch. The output follows the _p_r_o_j_e_c_t  for-
       mat  description. New projects can be created, and existing ones can be
       modified, via the --aapprrjj, --mmpprrjj and --ddpprrjj options to _q_c_o_n_f(1).

       Note, Grid Engine allows backslashes (\)  be  used  to  escape  newline
       characters.  The  backslash  and  the newline are replaced with a space
       character before any interpretation.

   oottiicckkeett
       The number of override tickets currently assigned to the project.

   ffsshhaarree
       The current functional share of the project.

   aaccll
       A list of user access lists (ACLs - see  _a_c_c_e_s_s___l_i_s_t(5))  referring  to
       those users allowed to submit jobs to the project.

       If  the  aaccll  parameter is set to NONE, all users are allowed to submit
       jobs to the project except for  those  listed  in  the  xxaaccll  parameter
       described below.

   xxaaccll
       A  list  of  user access lists (ACLs - see _a_c_c_e_s_s___l_i_s_t(5)) referring to
