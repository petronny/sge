       sge_priority - Grid Engine job priorities

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       Grid  Engine provides a means for controlling job dispatch and run-time
       priorities. The dispatch priority indicates the relative importance  of
       pending  jobs  and determines the order in which Grid Engine dispatches
       jobs to queue instances, if the relevant resources are  available.  The
       run-time priority determines the CPU allocation that the operating sys-
       tem assigns to jobs.

       A job's dispatch priority is affected by a number of factors:

       +o  the identity of the submitting user

       +o  the project under which the job is submitted (or alternatively,  the
          default project of the submitting user)

       +o  any resources requested by the job

       +o  the job's submit time

       +o  the job's initiation deadline time (if specified)

       +o  the  -p priority specified for the job (also known as the POSIX pri-
          ority "pprio")

       The effect of each of these is governed by the  overall  policy  setup,
       which  is  split  into three top-level contributions.  Each of these is
       configured  through  the  _s_c_h_e_d___c_o_n_f(5)   parameters   wweeiigghhtt__pprriioorriittyy,
       wweeiigghhtt__ttiicckkeett  and  wweeiigghhtt__uurrggeennccyy.   These three parameters control to
       what degree POSIX priority, ticket policy, and urgency  policy  are  in
       effect.    To    facilitate    interpretation,   the   raw   priorities
       ("tckts"/"urg"/"ppri")   are   normalized   ("ntckts"/"nurg"/"npprior")
       before  they are used to calculate job priorities ("prio").  Normaliza-
       tion maps each raw urgency/ticket/priority  value into a range  between
       0 and 1.

          npprior = normalized(ppri)
          nurg    = normalized(urg)
          ntckts  = normalized(tckts)

          prio    = weight_priority * npprio +
                    weight_urgency  * nurg +
                    weight_ticket   * ntckts

       The higher a job's priority value, the earlier it gets dispatched.

       The  urgency  policy defines an urgency value for each job. The urgency
       value

          urg     =  rrcontr + wtcontr + dlcontr

       consists of the  resource  requirement  contribution  ("rrcontr"),  the
       waiting  time  contribution  ("wtcontr")  and the deadline contribution
       ("dlcontr").

       The  resource  requirement  contribution  is  adding  up  all  resource
       requirements of a job into a single numeric value.

          rrcontr = Sum over all(hrr)

       with  an  "hrr"  for  each  hard  resource  request.   Depending on the
       resource type, two different methods are used to determine the value to
       be  used  for "hrr" here. For numeric type resource requests, the "hrr"
       represents how much of a resource a job requests (on a  per-slot  basis
       for PE jobs) and how "important" this resource is considered in compar-
       ison to other resources. This is expressed by the formula:

          hrr      = rurg * assumed_slot_allocation * request

       where the resource's urgency  value  ("rurg")  is  as  specified  under
       uurrggeennccyy in _c_o_m_p_l_e_x(5), the job's assumed_slot_allocation represents the
       number of slots supposedly  assigned  to  the  job,  and  the  per-slot
       request  is  that  which was specified using the -l _q_s_u_b(1) option. For
       string type requests the formula is simply

          hrr      = rurg

       and directly assigns the resource  urgency  value  as  specified  under
       uurrggeennccyy in _c_o_m_p_l_e_x(5).

       The waiting time contribution represents a weighted waiting time of the
       jobs

          wtcontr = waiting_time * weight_waiting_time

       with the waiting time in seconds and the wweeiigghhtt__wwaaiittiinngg__ttiimmee  value  as
       specified in _s_c_h_e_d___c_o_n_f(5).

       The  deadline  contribution  has  an increasing effect as jobs approach
       their deadline initiation time (see the -dl option in _q_s_u_b(1)).  It  is
       defined as the quotient of the wweeiigghhtt__ddeeaaddlliinnee value from _s_c_h_e_d___c_o_n_f(5)
       and the (steadily decreasing) free time in seconds until deadline  ini-
       tiation time

          dlcontr = weight_deadline / free_time

       or  is  set to 0 for non-deadline jobs.  After the deadline passes, the
       value is static and equal to weight_deadline.

       The ticket policy unites functional, override and share  tree  policies
       in  the  ticket  value  ("tckts"),  defined  as the sum of the specific
       ticket values  ("ftckt"/"otckt"/"stckt")  for  each  sub-policy  (func-
       tional, override, share):

           tckts = ftckt + otckt + stckt

       The ticket policies provide a broad range of means for influencing both
       job dispatch and runtime  priorities  on  a  per  job,  per  user,  per
       project, and per department basis. See the Grid Engine Installation and
       Administration Guide for details.

       The run-time priority can be dynamically adjusted in order to meet  the
       goals  set with the ticket policy. Dynamic run-time priority adjustment
       can be turned off (default)  globally  using  rreepprriioorriittiizzee__iinntteerrvvaall  in
       _s_c_h_e_d___c_o_n_f(5).  If no dynamic run-time priority adjustment is done at a
       host level, the pprriioorriittyy specification in _q_u_e_u_e___c_o_n_f(5) is in effect.

       Note that urgency and POSIX priorities do nnoott affect runtime priority.
