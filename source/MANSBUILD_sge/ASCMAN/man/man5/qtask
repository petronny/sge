QTASK(5)                   Grid Engine File Formats                   QTASK(5)

       qtask - file format of the qtask file.

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       A  _q_t_a_s_k  file  defines which commands are submitted to Grid Engine for
       remote execution by _q_t_c_s_h(1).  The _q_t_a_s_k file  optionally  may  contain
       _q_r_s_h(1)  command-line  parameters.  These  parameters are passed to the
       _q_r_s_h(1) command being used by _q_t_c_s_h to submit the commands.

       Both a cluster global _q_t_a_s_k file defining cluster wide defaults, and  a
       user specific _q_t_a_s_k file eventually overriding and enhancing those def-
       initions,  are  supported.  The  cluster   global   file   resides   at
       <sge_root>/<cell/common/qtask,  while  the  user  specific  file can be
       found at ~/.qtask. An exclamation mark preceding command definitions in
       the  cluster global file can be used by the administrator to deny over-
       riding of such commands by users.

FFOORRMMAATT
       The overall format of the _q_t_a_s_k file is that of a tabulated list.  Each
       line  starting with a '#' character is a comment line. Each non-comment
       line defines a command to be started remotely.

       Definition starts with the command name that  must  match  exactly  the
       name  as typed in a _q_t_c_s_h(1) command-line. Pathnames are not allowed in
       _q_t_a_s_k files. Hence absolute or relative pathnames in _q_t_c_s_h(1)  command-
       lines always lead to local execution, even if the command itself is the
       same as defined in the _q_t_a_s_k file.

       The command name can be followed by  an  arbitrary  number  of  _q_r_s_h(1)
       option arguments which are passed on to _q_r_s_h(1) by _q_t_c_s_h(1).

       An  exclamation  mark prefixing the command in the cluster global _q_t_a_s_k
       file prevents overriding by the user supplied _q_t_a_s_k file.

       The following _q_t_a_s_k file

              firefox -l a=sol-sparc64 -v DISPLAY=myhost:0
              grep -l h=filesurfer
              verilog -l veri_lic=1

       designates the applications firefox, grep and verilog  for  interactive
       remote  execution through Grid Engine. Firefox is requested to run only
       on Solaris64 architectures with the DISPLAY environment variable set to
       'myhost:0',  grep only runs on the host named 'filesurfer', and verilog
       requests availability of a verilog license in  order  to  get  executed
       remotely.
