       usermapping - user mapping entry file format

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       A  usermapping  entry is used to define alias names for a cluster user.
       The user's name known by the scheduling system is known as the  cluster
       user.  If  the  cluster  user doesn't match the user account name on an
       execution host, the usermapping feature can solve the problem.

       Each line in the usermapping entry file specifies a user name  and  the
       host(s) where he has an account.

       A  list  of  currently configured user mapping entries can be displayed
       via the _q_c_o_n_f(1) --ssuummaappll option. The contents  of  each  enlisted  user
       mapping  entry  can  be shown via the --ssuummaapp switch. The output follows
       the _u_s_e_r_m_a_p_p_i_n_g format description. New user entries can be created and
       existing  can  be modified via the --aauummaapp, --mmuummaapp and --dduummaapp options to
       _q_c_o_n_f(1).

       A user mapping entry contains two parameters:

   cclluusstteerr__uusseerr
       The cluster_user keyword defines the cluster user name. The rest of the
       textline after the keyword "cluster_user" will be taken as cluster user
       value.


   rreemmoottee__uusseerr
       The user name on an execution host. Please note that the value for this
       attribute might be overwritten for a certain hostgroups or single host.

       This is a typical user mapping entry for a cluster user mapping:


       cluster_user   peter

       remote_user    peter,[@linux=pet1],[fangorn=peter1]

       The entry will map the user peter which is defined in the cluster  sys-
       tem  to the user peter on all hosts in the cluster except for all hosts
       which are referenced in the hostgroup @linux. For all these  hosts  the
       user  will be mapped to pet1. For the host fangorn the remote user will
       be peter1.  _h_o_s_t_g_r_o_u_p(5) to obtain for more information about that.
