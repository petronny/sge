       hostgroup - host group entry file format

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       A  host  group entry is used to merge host names to groups.  Each  host
       group  entry  file defines one group. Inside a  group  definition  file
       you  can  also  reference  groups. These groups are called subgroups. A
       subgroup is referenced by the sign "@" as first character of the name.

       A list of currently-configured host group entries can be displayed  via
       the  _q_c_o_n_f(1)  --sshhggrrppll  option.  The contents of each listed host group
       entry can be shown via the --sshhggrrpp switch. The output follows the  _h_o_s_t_-
       _g_r_o_u_p  format  description.  New  host group entries can be created and
       existing can be modified via the  --aahhggrrpp,  --mmhhggrrpp,  --ddhhggrrpp  and  --??aattttrr
       options to _q_c_o_n_f(1).

       Note,  Grid  Engine  allows  backslashes  (\) be used to escape newline
       characters. The backslash and the newline are  replaced  with  a  space
       character before any interpretation.

       A host group entry contains the following parameters:

   ggrroouupp__nnaammee
       The  group_name  defines  the host group name. Host group names have to
       begin  with  an  '@'  character  as  explained  for  _h_o_s_t_g_r_o_u_p___n_a_m_e  in
       _s_g_e___t_y_p_e_s(5).

   hhoossttlliisstt
       The  names  of  all  hosts  and  host  groups  (see  _h_o_s_t___i_d_e_n_t_i_f_i_e_r in
       _s_g_e___t_y_p_e_s(1)) which are members  of  the  group.   Only  whitespace  is
       allowed  as  list  separators.  The default value for this parameter is
       NONE.

       Note, if the first character of the _h_o_s_t___i_d_e_n_t_i_f_i_e_r is an "@" sign  the
       name  is  used to reference a _h_o_s_t_g_r_o_u_p(5) which is taken as a subgroup
       of this group.

       This is a typical host group entry:


       group_name @bigMachines

       hostlist @solaris64 @solaris32 fangorn balrog

       The entry will define a new host group  called  @@bbiiggMMaacchhiinneess.  In  this
       host  group  are  the  host ffaannggoorrnn, bbaallrroogg and all members of the host
       groups @@ssoollaarriiss6644 and @@ssoollaarriiss3322.
