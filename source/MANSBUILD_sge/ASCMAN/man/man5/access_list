       access_list - Grid Engine access list file format

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       Access  lists  are  used in Grid Engine to define access permissions of
       users to queues  (see  _q_u_e_u_e___c_o_n_f(5))  or  parallel  environments  (see
       _s_g_e___p_e(5)).   A  list  of currently configured access lists can be dis-
       played via the _q_c_o_n_f(1) --ssuull option. The contents of each  access  list
       can shown via the --ssuu switch. The output follows the _a_c_c_e_s_s___l_i_s_t format
       description. New access lists can be created and existing can be  modi-
       fied via the --aauu and --dduu options to _q_c_o_n_f(1).

       Departments  are  a special form of access list that additionally allow
       assignment of functional shares and override tickets.

       Note, Grid Engine allows backslashes (\)  be  used  to  escape  newline
       characters.  The  backslash  and  the newline are replaced with a space
       character before any interpretation.

       The following list of _a_c_c_e_s_s___l_i_s_t parameters specifies the  _a_c_c_e_s_s___l_i_s_t
       content:

   nnaammee
       The  name  of  the  access  list  in  the  format  for  _u_s_e_r_s_e_t___n_a_m_e in
       _s_g_e___t_y_p_e_s(1).

   ttyyppee
       The type of the access list, currently  one  of _A_C_L_, or _D_E_P_T or a  com-
       bination of both in a comma separated list. Depending on this parameter
       the access list can be used as access list only or as a department.

   oottiicckkeett
       The amount of override tickets currently assigned to the department.

   ffsshhaarree
       The current functional share of the department.

   eennttrriieess
       The entries parameter contains the comma separated list of  those  UNIX
       users (see _u_s_e_r___n_a_m_e in _s_g_e___t_y_p_e_s(1)) or those primary UNIX groups that
       are assigned to the access list or the department. Only a  user's  pri-
       mary  UNIX  group  is used; secondary groups are ignored. Only symbolic
       names are allowed.  A group is differentiated from a user name by  pre-
       fixing the group name with a '@' sign.  Pure access lists allow listing
       any user or group in any access list.

       When using departments, each user or group may only be  listed  in  one
       department,  in  order to ensure a unique assignment of jobs to depart-
       ments.  If the _d_e_f_a_u_l_t_d_e_p_a_r_t_m_e_n_t is defined, it  is  assigned  to  jobs
       whose  users  do not match with any of the users or groups listed under
       _e_n_t_r_i_e_s.
