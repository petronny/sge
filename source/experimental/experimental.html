<h1>
Grid Engine <i>Experimental</i> Modules</h1>
Each subdirectory of gridengine/source/experimental contains an experimental
module. Those modules cannot be expected to work - although some may, at
least with a bit of work. The experimental modules are provided here for
information purposes mainly and may be helpful if you plan to enhance Grid
Engine in a direction similar to one of the modules. Some also can be a
valid starting point for such an effort.
<p>Several of the modules have been created back in a time when Grid Engine
was called CODINE and Grid Engine Enterprise Edition was known under the
name GRD. The source code of such modules does reflect the naming difference
as well as the documentation (as far as available). Substantial changes
have occurred to the source code since the creation of such older modules,
so be aware that considerable effort can be involved to get those modules
working. Note that none of the modules ever has been part of a productized
version of Grid Engine or its predecessors, so non of the modules has ever
seen hard end user testing.
<p>In the sections below we provide brief information for each module on
the functionality they implement, on their status and on the documentation
they include.
<h2>
<a NAME="culltrans"></a>culltrans</h2>
The module provides an automatic translation mechanism for Grid Engine
CULL list declarations (Common Usable List Library - see <a href="../libs/cull/cull.html">here</a>
for details) into CORBA IDL data structure definitions. The module was
created in combination with the <a href="#qidl">qidl</a> module below in
the context of a CORBA integration of Grid Engine (then Codine/GRD). Since
the creation of the module, some substantial changes have occurred to the
code which are thus not reflected in culltrans. Examples are the name change
into Grid Engine, restructuring of the code and implementation of the array
job functionality.
<p>Documentation, as far as available, is contained in the documentation
to <a href="#qidl">qidl</a>.
<p>Outside the CORBA integration context, the module should be usable as
a guideline for any form of automatic translation of CULL declarations
into other forms of data definitions.
<h2>
<a NAME="jgrid"></a>JGrid</h2>
JGrid is a Java(TM) technology overlay for Grid Engine that allows a program to
submit jobs as live objects over RMI.  It currently relies on the DRMAA Java
language binding. Documentation is in source files as JavaDoc(TM) comments.
<h2>
<a NAME="JAM"></a>JAM</h2>

JAM (for Job & Application Manager) is a proof-of-concept, Jini(TM) technology
based, graphical interface to Grid Engine.  Applications to be submitted
through this interface must be specially wrapped to be represented as Jini
services.  Grid Engine queues are automatically represented as Jini services,
as are jobs launched through JAM, which can be monitored and controlled through
this interface.  JAM utilizes JavaSapces(TM) technology to coordinate this job
monitoring & control.  JAM is compatible with the API (GDI) in Grid Engine 5.3.
<p>There is some documentation in the source tree, including a <a
href="jam/README.txt">README</a> file, a <a
href="jam/doc/JAM_Whitepaper.pdf">technical whitepaper</a>, and slides (<a
href="jam/doc/jamSC2000.pdf">pdf</a>; <a
href="jam/doc/jamSC2000.sdd">StarOffice</a>) from a presentation given in the
Sun Microsystems booth at the SC2000 trade show.  There are also javadoc
comments in the code, along with a Makefile target to generate the javadoc
documentation.
<h2>
<a NAME="jqmon"></a>jqmon</h2>
Jqmon is a very early prototype of a Java graphical user interface to Grid
Engine (back then Codine/GRD). It doesn't implement nearly as much functionality
as the Motif GUI qmon and it is really outdated now. However it uses the
Java Native Interface, JNI, to communicate with sge_qmaster. We felt it
might be useful to provide an example of how this can be done in case someone
would want to try to integrate Grid Engine into an existing Java application.
We have to stress though that the JNI is quite cumbersome to use for such
a purpose and we cannot really recommend it.
<p>The only documentation which exists for it is a diploma thesis describing
jqmon together with <a href="#qmon_nt">qmon_nt</a> (see below). The diploma
thesis is in German language and is not completely up-to-date with the
code. Please let us know whether it makes sense to provide it here.
<h2>
<a NAME="jqmon_corba"></a>jqmon_corba</h2>
Jqmon_corba originally was derived from <a href="#jqmon">jqmon</a> but
was changed substantially. Most notably, jqmon_corba uses CORBA to communicate
with sge_qmaster instead of the JNI used in jqmon. In order to work, jqmon_corba
requires a Grid Engine version incorporating the CORBA interface implemented
in <a href="#qidl">qidl</a>. Jqmon_corba offers an extended set of capabilities
compared to jqmon. It is still out of date with respect to the name change
into Grid Engine, restructuring of the code and implementation of the array
job functionality.
<p>Some jqmon_corba specific notes are contained in the qidl module and
can be viewed <a href="qidl/doc/Jqmon_Notes.txt">here</a>. See also the
comments related to <a href="#jqmon">jqmon</a> documentation above.
<h2>
perlgui</h2>
Perlgui provides two facilities, a Perl interface prototype to Grid Engine
and a GUI prototype implemented in Perl/Tk. The module is fairly recent
and it should be possible to get it working, maybe with a small bit of
effort. The <a href="http://www.swig.org">Swig</a> tool has been used to
generate some of the data exchange interfaces between Perl and Grid Engine.
The functionality of the Perl GUI is not as comprehensive as that of the
standard Motif qmon, but it implements a good set of features.
<p>A diploma thesis in German language describing the work is included
as documentation (click <a href="perlgui/doku/Diplomarbeit.sdw">here</a>
- StarOffice document, 600kB).
<h2>
<a NAME="qidl"></a>qidl</h2>
The qidl module contains a CORBA interface for Grid Engine (back then Codine/GRD).
It uses the <a href="#culltrans">culltrans</a> module to translate CULL
list declarations (Common Usable List Library - see <a href="../libs/cull/cull.html">here</a>
for details), which specify all Grid Engine internal objects, into corresponding
CORBA IDL definitions. These CORBA interfaces to Grid Engine internal data
are then accessible via a CORBA server running as a thread to sge_qmaster.
The multi-threading infrastructure supporting the regular sge_qmaster functionality
and the CORBA thread is part of the regular Grid Engine source code. Qidl
serves as an enabling infrastructure for <a href="#jqmon_corba">jqmon_corba</a>
(see above). Since the creation of qidl, some substantial changes have
occurred to the code which are thus not reflected in the module. Examples
are the name change into Grid Engine, restructuring of the code and implementation
of the array job functionality.
<p>Documentation is available in PostScript <a href="qidl/doc/report.ps">here</a>
(450kB). The corresponding TeX sources are part of the module.
<h2>
qidle</h2>
Qidle contains a small C-program which reports whether there is interactive
usage on a host. The reports are in a format compliant with the Grid Engine
load sensor interface (see the Grid Engine manual), so qidle can be used
to withdraw a host from a batch cluster if it is used interactively and
to make it available for batch jobs if the host has not been used by interactive
users for a while. Qidle also can be used to trigger suspend/resume events
for batch jobs or even checkpointing and migration. Interactive usage is
detected via monitoring the X-Server activity on the host. See the README
file included in the module for some important information in this context.
There is no further documentation besides the README.
<p>The module is relatively independent of the Grid Engine version, so
it should be possible to get qidle working, at least with a small bit of
effort.
<h2>
<a NAME="qmon_nt"></a>qmon_nt</h2>
Qmon_nt is a relatively advanced Microsoft<sup>&reg;</sup> Windows<sup>&reg;</sup>
GUI prototype for Grid Engine. It has been implemented with Microsoft<sup>&reg;
</sup>Visual
Studio<sup>&reg;</sup>. Since the creation of the qmon_nt, some substantial
changes have occurred to the code which are thus not reflected in the module.
Examples are the name change into Grid Engine, restructuring of the code
and implementation of the array job functionality.
<p>The only documentation which exists for it is a diploma thesis describing
qmon_nt together with <a href="#jqmon">jqmon</a> (see above). The diploma
thesis is in German language and is not completely up-to-date with the
code. Please let us know whether it makes sense to provide it here.
<p>The qmon_nt module may also serve as an example how to integrate an
existing Microsoft<sup>&reg;</sup> Windows<sup>&reg;</sup> application
as a client into the Grid Engine system.
<h2>
sge_host_mon</h2>
The sge_host_mon module has been implemented specifically to operate with
the SGI<sup>TM</sup> IRIX<sup>&reg;</sup> grosview facility. The sge_host_mon
utility accesses Grid Engine internal data about jobs executing on a particular
host and outputs it in a format compatible with grosview. The result is
a job activity display in grosview showing how much CPU percentage jobs
receive compared to each other. Sge_host_mon makes most sense in combination
with Grid Engine Enterprise Edition, where the CPU entitlement of jobs
changes dynamically and automatically.
<p>There is no documentation for sge_host_mon.
