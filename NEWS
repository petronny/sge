"[#<n>]" below refers to ticket <n> at
https://arc.liv.ac.uk/trac/SGE/ticket/<n>.  (The issues fixed by Univa
changes aren't publicly available, and many other changes have been
made without raising Trac tickets.)  Changes due to Univa (or Sun) are
tagged as "[U]", and items partially due to them or appearing first in
this version are tagged as "[(U)]".

Version 8.0.0a
--------------

This is roughly a superset of Univa's 8.0.0 (the V800_TAG from
https://github.com/gridengine/gridengine), with thanks for that.

Changes made there which haven't been included in this version:  PLPA
source not removed; some different build/installation defaults
(e.g. for JMX); Univa/UGE "branding" (partly because trademark status
is unknown); authuser not removed (for SDM and testing use),
