  * SGE_BINDING is set in the environment for all types of binding

    version built with qsort_args (as above), which will make live
    upgrades from such a version fail on nodes running parallel jobs

* Other changes

  * Extensive internal changes to improve robustness, e.g. of
    string-handling against buffer overruns -- somewhat error-prone
    and may have caused regressions; more required

  The first fix is for a trivial remote root by a valid user.  The
  others, including fixes for potential buffer overruns in daemon and
  setuid programs, may or may not be exploitable.

  * Sanitize the environment before executing remote startup programs etc.
    Somewhat incompatible:  LD_LIBRARY_PATH etc. may need to be set
    differently.  See the security notes in remote_startup(5) and
    sge_conf(5).  (CVE-2012-0208, thanks to William Hay)

    incompatible:  initial messages now in syslog.

    (Not normally a security issue.)
